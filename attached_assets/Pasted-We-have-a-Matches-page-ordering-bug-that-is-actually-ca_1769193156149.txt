We have a Matches page ordering bug that is actually caused by FRONTEND grouping, not backend sorting.

Evidence:
- Backend /api/matches/day?date=2026-01-23&status=all&sort=competition returns correct ordering (debug banner shows first = "Championship (England) [1205]").
- UI shows 2 Indonesian "Championship" fixtures above the England Championship fixture because the UI groups competitions by a stripped display label ("Championship"), merging different leagues with the same name.

Task: Fix frontend grouping + display so different competitions are never merged.

Requirements:
1) Use a UNIQUE grouping key for competitions:
   - Prefer goalserveCompetitionId (string) as group key.
   - If missing, fallback to the raw competition string (including country + [id]) or a derived leagueKey.
   - Do NOT use competitionDisplayName as group key.

2) Keep a display label, but ensure it does not cause collisions:
   - Build competitionDisplayName for the pill (e.g. strip "[id]" suffix).
   - Detect collisions on the current page: if more than one competition shares the same display label, show disambiguated labels including country (e.g. "Championship (England)" vs "Championship (Indonesia)").

3) Ensure rendering order stays exactly the server order:
   - Do NOT sort matches client-side (unless explicitly in "sort=kickoff" mode, but even then rely on server).
   - When grouping for display, preserve the FIRST OCCURRENCE order of competition groups based on the match array order.

Files likely involved:
- client/src/pages/matches.tsx (grouping logic)
- apiMatchToMockMatch mapper (ensure goalserveCompetitionId is available on the object used to render)
- EnhancedMatchCard / competition pill rendering (label disambiguation)

Acceptance criteria:
- On 2026-01-23, the England Championship fixture (Derby vs West Brom) appears before the Indonesian Championship fixtures in Competition sort mode.
- If multiple "Championship" leagues exist, the pill shows "Championship (England)" and "Championship (Indonesia)" (or equivalent), not both as just "Championship".
- The debug banner first/second/third competitions match what appears at the top of the list visually.
