TASK: Finalise FA Cup round ordering + restore “First Round”..“Fifth Round” support.

CONTEXT:
In /api/cup/progress we normalise a round name then map it to an integer order via a roundOrder dictionary.
Bug: code used `roundOrder[key] || 99`, which breaks when the mapped order is 0 (e.g. "1/8-finals"), because 0 is falsy and becomes 99.
Also ensure standard FA Cup "First Round" through "Fifth Round" mappings are present.

DO THIS:
1) Find the round ordering logic used by GET /api/cup/progress (likely in server/routes.ts or a helper file).
2) Ensure normalisation + lookup use consistent casing:
   - EITHER make normalizeRoundName() return lowercased output
   - OR lowercase the lookup key: `const key = normalizedName.toLowerCase()`
   (Choose the cleanest + most consistent approach in the file.)
3) Restore/ensure these mappings exist (keys should match your chosen casing):
   - "first round"  -> order for First Round Proper (after qualifying)
   - "second round" -> order
   - "third round"  -> order
   - "fourth round" -> order
   - "fifth round"  -> order
   Keep the existing qualifying mappings too (Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, 1st–4th Qualifying, etc).
4) Fix the falsy-zero bug by replacing:
      `roundOrder[key] || 99`
   with:
      `roundOrder[key] ?? 99`
   so 0 is respected.
5) Ensure these fractional rounds map uniquely:
   - 1/128-finals => -4
   - 1/64-finals  => -3
   - 1/32-finals  => -2
   - 1/16-finals  => -1
   - 1/8-finals   => 0
   - Quarter-finals => 1
   - Semi-finals    => 2
   - Final          => 3
6) Remove any debug logging you added.
7) Update docs (replit.md or docs/BUILD_LOG.md – whichever you’re using) to note:
   - We use `??` not `||` because order can be 0.
   - List the round ordering table above.

ACCEPTANCE TEST:
export DOMAIN="https://f04e3e83-5dee-4d43-ba21-fba6506a8e19-00-3rjffbqt7u6wn.spock.replit.dev"

curl -sS "$DOMAIN/api/cup/progress?competitionId=1198&season=2025/2026" \
| grep -Eo '"name":"[^"]+","order":-?[0-9]+,"matches":\[' \
| sed -E 's/"name":"([^"]+)","order":(-?[0-9]+).*/\2\t\1/' \
| sort -n \
| nl -ba

Expected to include (in this order):
-4  1/128-finals
-3  1/64-finals
-2  1/32-finals
-1  1/16-finals
 0  1/8-finals
 1  Quarter-finals
 2  Semi-finals
(and Final as 3 when present)

DELIVERABLE:
Commit with message: "Fix FA Cup round ordering (use ??, restore First–Fifth Round mappings)".
