MATCHWEEK TOGGLE STILL BROKEN — FIX + INSTRUMENT

Context:
Tables > Leagues (Premier League etc) has a “Fixtures” sidebar with a Matchweek toggle (prev/next). The UI renders, but clicking prev/next does NOTHING (no change in the list, no title change). We need it fully wired.

Please do the following in the client:

1) ADD TEMP DEBUG LOGGING (remove once fixed)
- In the Matchweek toggle component, add a console.log when:
  - prev is clicked
  - next is clicked
  - onChange is called
  Log: { action: 'prev'|'next'|'select', currentKey, nextKey, roundsLength }
- In the parent component that owns state (Tables league page / league-progress component), add console.log when:
  - selectedRound changes
  - data (rounds/matchesByRound) changes
  Log: { selectedRound, availableRoundKeys: rounds.map(r=>r.key), hasMatches: !!matchesByRound[selectedRound] }

2) ENSURE THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR SELECTED ROUND
- In the parent component, implement:
  const [selectedRound, setSelectedRound] = useState<string | null>(null)
- Only this state controls:
  - the highlighted matchweek in the toggle
  - the “Matchweek X” heading
  - the fixtures list data source

3) WIRE PREV/NEXT CORRECTLY
- In the toggle, accept props:
  - rounds: Array<{ key: string; label: string; dateRange?: string }>
  - selectedKey: string
  - onChange: (key: string) => void
- Implement prev/next by finding current index:
  const idx = rounds.findIndex(r => r.key === selectedKey)
  prev -> if idx > 0 call onChange(rounds[idx-1].key)
  next -> if idx < rounds.length-1 call onChange(rounds[idx+1].key)
- Disable prev/next at ends.

4) FIX THE “KEY MISMATCH” BUG (MOST LIKELY CAUSE)
- Right now the UI displays “Matchweek 0” and the rounds probably use numbers while matchesByRound uses strings (or vice versa).
- Standardise the key format in the CLIENT before rendering:
  Create a helper:
    const normaliseRoundKey = (k: unknown) => String(k).startsWith('MW') ? String(k) : `MW${String(k)}`
  Ensure:
    - rounds keys are normalised (e.g. MW1, MW2...)
    - selectedRound always stores a normalised key
    - matchesByRound is accessed with the normalised key
  If matchesByRound is keyed by numbers (0,1,2) instead, then do the opposite:
    - create normaliseRoundIndex = (key: string) => parseInt(key.replace('MW',''),10)
    - access matchesByRound[roundIndex]
  IMPORTANT: pick ONE and make rounds + selection + lookup consistent.

5) REMOVE STALE MEMO ISSUES
- If fixtures list is computed with useMemo, ensure dependencies include:
  [selectedRound, matchesByRound, rounds]
- If you do derivedSelectedRound in useMemo, ensure it reruns when query params OR data changes.

6) URL SYNC (OPTIONAL BUT NICE)
- When onChange fires, update URL query param ?mw=MWxx
- On first load, initialise from URL if present and valid.

7) ACCEPTANCE TEST
- Clicking prev/next must change:
  - the toggle highlight
  - the “Matchweek X” heading
  - the fixtures list rows
- Console logs should show correct keys and that matchesByRound[selectedRound] resolves.
- After confirmed, remove or gate console logs behind a dev flag.

Deliverable:
- Commit working toggle behaviour. Keep layout unchanged.
