You are working in the Football Mad Replit project.

Goal: fix 3 UX issues on the Matches page:
1) Remove the green “Today” button (it’s redundant because the date picker already shows Today).
2) Implement proper priority ordering so UK leagues come first, then Big 5 European leagues, then UEFA comps, then everything else.
3) Fix date navigation so moving to tomorrow/other dates loads the FULL set of fixtures for that date (not a tiny subset / sometimes empty).

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change the database schema.
- Keep the existing Matches UI layout with everything on one line on desktop and stacked on mobile.
- Use the existing /api/matches/day endpoint (or adjust it) so the frontend is date-driven.

PART A — BACKEND: make /api/matches/day date-correct and sortable
1) Find the /api/matches/day route in server/routes.ts.
2) Ensure the endpoint filters by the selected calendar day reliably using the DB’s kickoff_time column (timestamp without time zone).
   - Accept query params:
     - date=YYYY-MM-DD (required; default to today in UTC if missing)
     - status=all|live|scheduled|fulltime (default all)
     - competitionId=optional
   - Build the day window as:
     - start = `${date} 00:00:00`
     - end   = `${nextDate} 00:00:00`
     - Compare using kickoff_time >= start AND kickoff_time < end
     - IMPORTANT: do not use NOW() for excluding earlier kickoffs within that day — if the user selects a date, return all matches for that date.
3) Status filtering rules (case-insensitive):
   - FINISHED_STATUSES: finished, ft, full_time, ended, final, aet
   - LIVE_STATUSES: live, inplay, in_play, ht, halftime, et, extra_time, penalties, pen, 1h, 2h
   - scheduled: anything NOT in finished statuses AND NOT in live statuses
   - fulltime: in finished statuses
   - live: in live statuses OR status looks like a minute number (regex ^[0-9]+$)
   - all: no status constraint other than being within the selected day
4) Add priority ordering server-side (so the API returns ordered results):
   - Create a helper normalizeCompetitionName() that strips country prefixes like “Country: ” and removes bracket IDs “ [1234]” and trims.
   - Create getCompetitionPriority(name) returning a low number for higher priority.
   - Priority groups (highest → lowest):
     A) UK: Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two, National League, FA Cup, EFL Cup/Carabao Cup
     B) Big 5: La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Eredivisie
     C) UEFA: Champions League, Europa League, Conference League
     D) Everything else
   - Implement ordering as:
     (priority ASC), (kickoff_time ASC), (competition name ASC)
   - If competition is null, treat it as lowest priority.
5) Keep response shape unchanged (id, kickoffTime, status, scores, venue, competition, goalserveCompetitionId, team objects, etc.).
6) Add a debug=1 option that returns { date, start, end, status, competitionId, returnedCount, sampleFirst5 } to help verify the day window.

PART B — FRONTEND: remove Today button + ensure date navigation refetches
1) In client/src/pages/matches.tsx:
   - Remove the separate green “Today” button entirely (UI + state + handlers).
   - Keep the date picker and left/right arrows.
2) Ensure date changes trigger refetch:
   - selectedDate should be stored as a YYYY-MM-DD string.
   - The React Query key MUST include: ["matches-day", selectedDate, activeStatusTab, selectedCompetitionId]
   - The fetch URL must be: `/api/matches/day?date=${selectedDate}&status=${status}&competitionId=${selectedCompetitionId}`
     (omit competitionId when empty).
3) Fix the label:
   - When selectedDate == today: show “Today — Fri 23 Jan”
   - Otherwise: show “Sat 24 Jan 2026” (or similar), with no “Tomorrow” heading.
   - The page heading under filters should match the selected date label too.
4) Competition dropdown:
   - Ensure there is only ONE competition dropdown.
   - Options should be derived from the returned matches for that day (unique goalserveCompetitionId + competition name).
5) If the backend sorts, do NOT re-sort differently on the client. Just render in the order received.

PART C — VERIFICATION STEPS (run after changes)
1) Hit the API:
   - curl -sS "http://localhost:5000/api/matches/day?date=2026-01-23&status=all&debug=1" | head
   - curl -sS "http://localhost:5000/api/matches/day?date=2026-01-24&status=all&debug=1" | head
   Confirm returnedCount is > 0 for dates that have fixtures.
2) In the UI:
   - Confirm “Today” button is gone.
   - Clicking next day loads a different (non-empty where applicable) list.
   - UK leagues appear first when present, then Big 5, then UEFA, then the rest.

Deliverable:
- Make the minimum necessary code changes across server/routes.ts and client/src/pages/matches.tsx (and small shared helpers if needed) to satisfy the above.
- Explain briefly what you changed and where.
