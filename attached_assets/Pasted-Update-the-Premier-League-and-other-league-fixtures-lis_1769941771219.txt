Update the Premier League (and other league) fixtures list layout in client/src/pages/tables.tsx.

GOAL (design rules):
1) The “pill” area above the row should show:
   - For LIVE: a pill like "LIVE 63'" (minute if available) OR "LIVE"
   - For HT: a pill "HT"
   - For FT (and other completed statuses): a pill "FT" or "Full-Time" (keep existing label you already use)
   - For SCHEDULED (not live, not completed): DO NOT show a status pill. Instead show the match date text, formatted exactly like: "Sun 1 Feb"
2) The main row line should be inline with team names:
   - If match is LIVE or COMPLETED: show the score between teams (e.g. "2–1")
   - If match is SCHEDULED: show the kickoff time between teams (e.g. "14:00") instead of a scoreline.
3) Remove the “Scheduled” badge entirely (do not render it anywhere).
4) If the matchweek spans multiple dates, still show the date above each scheduled match row.
   If the matchweek is single-day, you can still show the date above scheduled matches (that’s fine and consistent) OR keep it only when multi-day — choose the cleaner option but MUST avoid ambiguity (your current issue was the Monday fixture looking like it followed Sunday).
   Recommendation: always show the date above scheduled matches.
5) IMPORTANT: do not introduce any new hooks inside nested render helpers. If you need “multiDay” logic, compute it without hooks.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Reuse existing helper functions you already added: isLeagueMatchLive(), isLeagueMatchCompleted(), formatLeagueStatusLabel(), etc.
- Add a date formatter for scheduled matches:
   - Input: match.kickoffDate in "YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Output: "Sun 1 Feb" (short weekday, day number, short month)
   - Use Intl.DateTimeFormat with locale "en-GB" and timeZone "Europe/London" so it matches UK expectations.
- For scheduled matches, the middle column should be kickoffTime (HH:mm). For live/completed, middle column should be score.
- Keep everything else (toggle, sorting, API shapes) unchanged.

Deliverable:
- Only modify client/src/pages/tables.tsx
- Provide a short summary of the changes made.
- Do NOT run tests.
