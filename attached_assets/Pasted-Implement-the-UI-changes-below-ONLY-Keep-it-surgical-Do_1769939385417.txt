Implement the UI changes below ONLY. Keep it surgical. Do NOT run tests or long scripts; I will verify manually.

GOAL
League fixtures (Tables > Leagues) should match this layout:
- For completed/live matches: show a status pill (Live + minute if available, Half-Time, Full-Time) ABOVE the row.
- The scoreline should be inline between team names (Home 2–1 Away).
- For scheduled matches: remove status pill entirely and replace score with kickoff time inline between team names (Home 15:00 Away).
- Remove “Scheduled” pill completely.

SCOPE
Update the League fixtures rendering in: client/src/pages/tables.tsx (or wherever LeagueMatchRow / league fixtures list is defined).
Do not change Europe components unless you must.

REQUIREMENTS

1) STATUS PILL (only for Live/HT/FT)
- Render a pill ONLY when status indicates: Live, Half-Time, Full-Time (or equivalents currently supported).
- Put the pill in its own line ABOVE the row content (aligned nicely, not inside the scoreline).
- For Live: include minute if available (examples: "Live 67'", "Live 90+2").
  - Extract minute from any of:
    - match.minute
    - match.time
    - match.status if it contains digits like 67 or 90+2 (use a regex)
  - If no minute is found, use “Live”.
- Keep existing variants/styling for Live/HT/FT; just reposition and improve label text.

2) ROW CONTENT (single line)
- Always render: Home team name — middle — Away team name
- Middle section rules:
  a) If match is completed/live/HT:
     - show score inline, e.g. "2 - 1"
     - Use existing score fields already in the model (don’t invent).
  b) If match is scheduled (no FT/HT/Live):
     - show kickoff time inline instead of score, e.g. "15:00"
     - If kickoffTime missing, fall back to "TBC".
- Remove any "Scheduled" text/badge anywhere.

3) ORDERING (keep from previous instruction if already implemented)
- Ensure matches within a selected matchweek are sorted by kickoff datetime ascending before rendering.
- kickoff datetime = kickoffDate + kickoffTime (use 00:00 if missing).

4) KEEP EXISTING DATA MODEL
- Do not change API contracts.
- Only adjust frontend presentation + minor helper functions.

DELIVERABLE
- Update the relevant component(s).
- Keep styling consistent with existing UI (spacing, typography).
- Output a short summary: files changed + what changed.
