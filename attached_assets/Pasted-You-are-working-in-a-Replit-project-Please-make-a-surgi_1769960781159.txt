You are working in a Replit project. Please make a surgical frontend fix so that each league defaults to its own current matchweek, instead of inheriting the previous league’s `round` query param.

Context:
- /tables currently uses a global query param like `?round=MW24`.
- When switching league tabs (Premier League → Championship etc), the URL does NOT change, so the new league incorrectly stays stuck on the old round.
- We already have `defaultMatchweek` coming back from `/api/standings` for each league/season, and round keys are `MW1..MW46` etc depending on league.

Goal:
1) Add `league` as a query param in the URL for league tables:
   Example: `/tables?league=premier-league&season=2025/26&round=MW24`
2) When the user changes league tab, automatically update the URL:
   - set `league=<newLeagueSlug>`
   - set `round=MW<defaultMatchweek from that league’s API response>`
   - preserve `season`
   This ensures Championship does NOT inherit Premier League’s round.
3) When the user manually toggles matchweeks, update ONLY the `round` query param (and keep `league` + `season` intact).
4) Avoid “Rendered more hooks than during the previous render” regressions — do not introduce hooks inside conditional render helpers.

Implementation notes (client/src/pages/tables.tsx):
- Read initial league from URL: `const urlLeague = searchParams.get("league") ?? "premier-league";`
- Ensure selected league state is initialised from `urlLeague`.
- When league changes (user clicks a different league tab), immediately update search params:
    `league=<slug>`
    `season=<season>`
    `round=` should be set once the API response for that league is available:
       use `standingsData?.defaultMatchweek` and build `MW${defaultMatchweek}`.
    If `defaultMatchweek` is missing, fall back to:
       - the first available round key in `leagueRounds`, else "MW1".
- Important: when switching leagues, reset any “hasInitializedRound” / round init guard so the new league can re-init from its own default.
- Ensure the URL is updated via the existing URL sync wrapper (or add a small helper `setUrlParams({league, season, round})`).

Deliverable:
- Update client/src/pages/tables.tsx so switching leagues updates URL and round correctly per league.
- Keep behaviour for Europe/Cups unchanged.
- After change, navigating directly to `/tables?league=championship&season=2025/26` should auto-select the Championship default matchweek and set `round=MWxx` in the URL.

Once done, briefly tell me what you changed and where.
