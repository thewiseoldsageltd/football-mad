We need the Season dropdown on the Tables page to control ALL leagues/cups/europe tables, and to update the SEO URL.

🚫 DO NOT run regression tests
🚫 DO NOT generate preview videos
🚫 DO NOT add tests or run Playwright/Cypress
I will test manually after deployment.

CURRENT URL FORMAT:
 /tables/{league-slug}/{season}
Example: /tables/championship/2023-24

GOAL BEHAVIOUR:
- Selecting a season updates the URL and becomes the single source of truth.
- Switching competition tabs keeps the same season.
- The page fetches standings for (activeLeagueSlug + season) every time.
- Season selection must apply globally (Leagues/Cups/Europe tabs).

FILES LIKELY INVOLVED:
client/src/pages/tables.tsx
client/src/components/tables/tables-filters.tsx
client/src/lib/urls.ts (if it has builders)
client/src/lib/league-config.ts (for goalserveLeagueId mapping)
server/routes.ts (/api/standings already supports season param)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1) Tables page should read `leagueSlug` and `season` from the route (React Router).
   - If season is missing, redirect to current season (e.g. 2025-26).
   - Season is stored as URL segment like "2023-24" (not "2023/24").

2) Season dropdown:
   - Displays labels like "2025/26", "2024/25", etc.
   - On change, NAVIGATE to `/tables/${activeLeagueSlug}/${newSeasonSlug}`
     where seasonSlug is "YYYY-YY" (e.g., 2024-25).

3) Competition tabs (Premier League, Championship, etc.):
   - On change, NAVIGATE to `/tables/${newLeagueSlug}/${currentSeasonSlug}`.
   - Do NOT reset season on league change.

4) Data fetch:
   - Wherever tables.tsx calls the API for standings, include season from URL.
   - Use goalserveLeagueId from league-config for the active league slug.
   - Call `/api/standings?leagueId=${goalserveLeagueId}&season=${seasonParam}`

5) Season param normalization:
   - The API expects a season string consistent with what standings ingestion uses.
   - Implement a small helper:
       seasonSlugToApiSeason("2024-25") => "2024-25" (or whatever server expects)
   - Keep it consistent across client and server. Avoid mixing "2024/25" vs "2024-25" in requests.

DELIVERABLE:
- Season dropdown updates the URL.
- Switching between leagues/cups/europe retains the season.
- Standings shown match the selected season (once backfilled).
- No change to fixtures sidebar rules.
