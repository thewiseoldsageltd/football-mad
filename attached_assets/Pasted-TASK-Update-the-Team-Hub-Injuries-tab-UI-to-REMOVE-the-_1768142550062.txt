TASK: Update the Team Hub > Injuries tab UI to REMOVE the circular percentage badge and REPLACE it with a player headshot/avatar, while keeping sorting/filtering powered by the FPL chance field.

CONTEXT:
- We are ingesting FPL availability data (chance of playing + news text + last updated).
- Currently the UI shows a big circular % badge and also shows the % in the news text, which is confusing and can mismatch (e.g. badge says 100 but text says 75%).
- We want ONE source of truth for the displayed %: the text line derived from the same numeric field used for sorting/filtering.

REQUIREMENTS (UI/UX):
1) Remove the circular percentage badge entirely.
2) Replace the left-side circle with:
   - Player headshot image (preferred)
   - If headshot URL not available, fallback to:
     a) a generic player silhouette icon OR
     b) initials in a subtle circle (same style used elsewhere in the site).
3) Keep the position pill (GKP/DEF/MID/FWD) visible and consistent with FPL position codes.
4) The “news” line must display the % ONLY once, e.g.:
   - "{news} — {chance}% chance of playing" when chance is a number
   - If chance is null/undefined, show "{news} — Chance unknown"
   - For 0% chance, prefer: "{news} — Expected return: {returnDateOrUnknown}"
     If no return date, keep: "Unknown return date"
5) Sorting/filtering must continue to work off the numeric chance field:
   - “Most Recent” sorts by last_updated DESC
   - “Lowest %” sorts by chance ASC (treat null as lowest or push to bottom—choose the most sensible UX and be consistent)
   - Any existing filters (0%, <=25, etc.) should still work using the stored numeric value, NOT string parsing.
6) Ensure there is no duplicated % display anywhere else on the card.

DATA MAPPING / SOURCE OF TRUTH:
- The displayed % must come from the same numeric field used for sorting/filtering (e.g. `chanceOfPlaying` or `chance_of_playing_next_round`).
- Do not derive the displayed % by parsing the `news` string.
- If the current ingestion stores both a numeric chance and a news string that contains a different %, ALWAYS trust the numeric chance and do not append a second % from the news.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Update the Injury/Availability card component on the Team Hub Injuries tab.
- Add a `PlayerAvatar` (or similar) subcomponent:
  - Props: playerName, photoUrl (optional), fallbackInitials
  - Size: roughly similar footprint to the old circle badge
  - Rounded, subtle border, consistent with site design
- If we already have a player image field in the DB, use it.
- If not, keep UI ready for it: use `player.photoUrl` if present, else fallback.
- Don’t break the current layout spacing—keep cards aligned.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS:
- No circular % badge visible anywhere on Injuries tab.
- Each card shows a headshot/avatar on the left.
- The text line shows the % once and matches the numeric value used for sorting.
- “Lowest %” and “Most Recent” still work exactly as before.
- No mismatch possible between a badge number and the text.

Please implement the above changes and tell me which files/components were modified.
