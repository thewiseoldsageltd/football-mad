You are working in Football Mad (Replit). We need to fix the Matches page UI + polish competition display.

GOAL
1) Remove the duplicate “competitions” dropdown (we should only have ONE).
2) Stop showing the competitionId in the dropdown labels and in the match “competition pill”.
3) Replace “(Country)” text with a small country flag icon (or a simple fallback icon if unknown).
4) Answer: do club crests exist in Goalserve feeds? If not, implement a clean path forward without breaking UI.

CONTEXT (what I’m seeing)
- There are TWO dropdowns next to each other:
  - One says “All competitions” (lowercase) and is the one with the populated list (this is the NEW one we just added).
  - Another says “All Competitions” (title case) (this is the OLD existing one).
- Competition is currently displayed like: “Catarinense (Brazil) [1140]” both in the dropdown and on the match pill.

TASK A — REMOVE THE DUPLICATE DROPDOWN
- Open: client/src/pages/matches.tsx
- Find the existing/old competition dropdown (the one that renders “All Competitions”) and REMOVE it from the layout.
- Keep ONLY the new Select-based competition dropdown we added (the one that is populated from API data).
- Do not remove the “Kick-off time” dropdown or the search input.

TASK B — CLEAN COMPETITION DISPLAY (NO ID IN UI)
In client/src/pages/matches.tsx:
1) Add helper functions near the top:
   - parseCompetitionLabel(competition: string | null | undefined) -> { name: string; country?: string; id?: string }
     Rules:
     - If it matches: "<NAME> (<COUNTRY>) [<ID>]" extract all three.
       Example: "Catarinense (Brazil) [1140]" => name="Catarinense", country="Brazil", id="1140"
     - If it matches: "<COUNTRY>: <NAME>" extract country + name
       Example: "Libya: Premier League" => country="Libya", name="Premier League"
     - Else: name = original string
2) Add displayCompetitionName(competition: string | null | undefined) that returns ONLY the readable name (no country, no [id]).
   Examples:
   - "Catarinense (Brazil) [1140]" => "Catarinense"
   - "Premier League (Jamaica) [1270]" => "Premier League"
   - "Libya: Premier League" => "Premier League"
3) Update:
   - competitionOptions labels in the dropdown to use displayCompetitionName(...)
   - Match “competition pill” to use displayCompetitionName(match.competition)

TASK C — COUNTRY FLAG ICON (REPLACE “(Brazil)” TEXT)
Still in client/src/pages/matches.tsx:
1) Add getFlagEmoji(countryName: string) -> string | null
   - Implement a small mapping for common countries we’ll see (at least):
     Brazil, Argentina, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium,
     USA, Mexico, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela,
     Jamaica, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, South Africa
   - Return an emoji flag (e.g. Brazil -> 🇧🇷). If unknown return null.
2) In both:
   - the dropdown item render
   - and the match competition pill render
   Show:
   - a tiny flag (emoji is fine) BEFORE the competition name when we have a country
   - fallback icon (e.g. 🌍) if country exists but not mapped
   - if no country, show nothing extra
3) IMPORTANT: The UI should NOT show country as text anymore (no “(Brazil)”).

TASK D — TEAM CRESTS (WHAT’S POSSIBLE NOW)
Implement the safest incremental solution:
1) Confirm in code comments and a short console note:
   - Goalserve match feed provides team ids/names but DOES NOT reliably provide crest image URLs.
2) Add a TODO path forward (no breaking changes):
   - If the Team object from mapped teams already has a crest/logo field (check existing Team type usage), then render it.
   - Otherwise keep the letter avatar.
3) In Matches list rendering:
   - If homeTeam has a usable crest/logo URL field (common names to check: crestUrl, logoUrl, badgeUrl, imageUrl), render <img> in the avatar slot.
   - Else render current letter badge.

DELIVERABLES
- Only edit client/src/pages/matches.tsx for UI changes.
- Keep the API contract as-is.
- After changes, the top filter row should show:
  [days buttons] [ONE competitions dropdown] [Kick-off time dropdown] [Search]
- Dropdown options should be clean like “🇧🇷 Catarinense” (no id, no (Brazil))
- Match pills should be clean like “🇧🇷 Catarinense” as well.

TEST STEPS (run mentally + quick manual check)
- Load Matches page.
- Confirm only one competitions dropdown exists and it’s populated.
- Selecting a competition filters fixtures.
- No “[1140]” visible anywhere in UI.
- No “(Brazil)” text visible; we see a flag emoji instead.
- Team avatars still render letters, but will render images if a logo/crest URL exists on mapped teams.

Go implement now and report back exactly what you removed/changed (brief bullet list) plus a screenshot if possible.
