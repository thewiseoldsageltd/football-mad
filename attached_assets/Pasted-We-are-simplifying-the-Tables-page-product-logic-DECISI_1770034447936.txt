We are simplifying the Tables page product logic.

DECISION:
Only these competitions should show a round-based fixtures widget:

• Premier League → label: “Matchweek”
• Champions League → label: “Matchday”
• Europa League → label: “Matchday”
• Conference League → label: “Matchday”

ALL OTHER LEAGUES (Championship, League One, League Two, National League, etc) should NOT use any Matchweek/Matchday/Round logic.

Instead, they should show:
• League table as normal
• Fixtures list in simple chronological order (upcoming + recent)
• NO round header
• NO round navigation arrows
• NO “Matchweek X” or “Round X” labels

---

FRONTEND CHANGES (tables page)

1. Create a helper:

const competitionRoundMode = (leagueSlug: string) => {
  if (leagueSlug === "premier-league") return "matchweek";
  if (["champions-league","europa-league","conference-league"].includes(leagueSlug)) return "matchday";
  return null;
};

2. Use this to conditionally render the round widget:

const roundMode = competitionRoundMode(activeLeagueSlug);

If roundMode === null:
  • Hide the entire Fixtures round header block
  • Hide round navigation chevrons
  • Hide round label
  • Instead, render fixtures as a flat list sorted by kickoff datetime:
      - Upcoming first (ascending date)
      - Then recent completed matches (descending date)
  • Keep existing fixture row design (status pill, scoreline, kickoff time)

If roundMode !== null:
  • Keep existing Matchweek / Matchday widget exactly as-is
  • Only change the label text dynamically:
      roundMode === "matchweek" → "Matchweek"
      roundMode === "matchday" → "Matchday"

3. Remove any logic that tries to compute default rounds for non-PL / non-European competitions.

4. Make sure this does NOT affect:
  • Premier League matchweek navigation
  • European matchday navigation

BACKEND CHANGES

1. Do NOT compute or return "latestRoundKey" or "latestActiveRoundKey" for leagues other than:
   • Premier League
   • Champions League
   • Europa League
   • Conference League

2. For all other leagues, just return fixtures normally without grouping logic.

GOAL RESULT

• Premier League still shows “Matchweek 24”
• Champions League shows “Matchday 6”
• Championship, League One, League Two etc:
   → Show fixtures list only
   → No Matchweek header
   → No broken date ranges

Keep all existing styles.
Make minimal changes.
Add comments explaining this is an intentional product decision.
