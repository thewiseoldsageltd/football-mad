You are working in the Football Mad web app codebase (Next.js/React + Tailwind). Update the GLOBAL “Transfers” page UI to “level up” UX using TEAM CRESTS (YES) and COLOUR (minimal/controlled), and also clean up the information hierarchy so the page is instantly scannable.

GOAL
- Make transfers easy to scan: WHO, FROM→TO, WHAT (loan/permanent), STATUS (confirmed/rumour), VALUE/DATE, SOURCE, CONFIDENCE (rumours only).
- Add team crests beside club names (small, consistent sizing).
- Keep cards neutral; no full club-colour cards. Colour only for status + small accent (optional) and confidence bar.
- Remove the current “random” placement of ticks/check-marks, pills, source tags, etc. Make everything consistent.

SCOPE
- Only the GLOBAL Transfers page and its TransferCard component(s) used on that page.
- Do not change the Team Hub transfers section in this pass (unless it shares the same TransferCard, then make changes in a way that doesn’t break Team Hub — use a prop or variant if needed).

DATA ASSUMPTIONS
- The current dummy transfer objects include: playerName, position, fromTeam, toTeam, type (loan/permanent), status (rumour/confirmed), fee (number/string, optional), date (string), confidence (0–100 optional), tier (A/B/C optional), source (string optional), isOfficial (boolean optional), isFPL (boolean optional).
- If a field is missing, handle gracefully (no empty placeholders).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

1) TRANSFER CARD: STANDARD LAYOUT (desktop + mobile responsive)
Create a single consistent layout for all cards:

HEADER ROW
- Left: Player name (bold) + Position chip (small neutral chip)
- Right: ONE status badge:
  - Confirmed: green badge “Confirmed”
  - Rumour: grey badge “Rumour”
  - Optional: if status confirmed and you have an “Official” source, show badge text “Confirmed • Official” (still one badge)
- REMOVE the floating green tick/checkmark icon entirely (it adds noise and duplicates status).

CLUB MOVEMENT ROW (most important scan row)
- Use: [fromCrest] From Team  →  [toCrest] To Team
- Crest sizing: 20–24px desktop, 18–20px mobile; circular or rounded-square container consistent with site style.
- Crests must be aligned vertically with team names.
- If crest not found, fall back to existing team initial avatar.

DEAL ROW
- Left: Deal type pill (Loan / Permanent) using subtle style:
  - Loan: blue-tinted pill
  - Permanent: green-tinted pill
- Next to it (same row): Fee/value if present (e.g. “£25m”, “Undisclosed”, “Free”, “Loan”) in a strong but not headline style.
- Right: Date (muted)

RUMOUR-ONLY META (only show for rumours)
- Confidence label + % and a single progress bar beneath (keep bar colour consistent across site; do not make it club-colour).
- If tier exists, show Tier chip near the confidence label (e.g. “Tier A”) with neutral/tinted style.
- If confidence missing, hide the entire confidence block.

FOOTER ROW
- Left: Source chip (e.g. “The Athletic”, “Fabrizio Romano”). If missing, hide.
- Right: Optional small tag chips like “FPL” only if relevant (keep subtle).

CARD STYLE
- Neutral background (white), soft border, subtle shadow, rounded corners consistent with other pages.
- No club-colour backgrounds.
- Optional: VERY subtle 2–3px left accent line that uses ONLY destination club colour, but keep low saturation/opacity (10–15%). Make this optional behind a boolean constant `USE_DEST_ACCENT = false` so we can flip it later without refactor.

2) TEAM CREST SUPPORT
Implement a simple `TeamCrest` component:
- Input: teamName (string)
- Output:
  - If crest asset exists in `/public/crests/` or similar folder: render next/image with that path.
  - Else fallback to existing “team initial” avatar component.
- Create a minimal mapping function:
  - Normalise names (lowercase, trim, replace spaces with hyphens).
  - Example: “Manchester City” -> “manchester-city.png”
- Do NOT import external assets; rely on local assets if they exist. If none exist, fallback should look good.
- Ensure the layout still looks great even with all fallbacks.

3) FILTERS / PAGE HEADER (do not break existing nav consistency)
- Keep existing sub-navigation tabs (All, Rumours, Confirmed) as-is.
- Keep “All Teams” dropdown filter.
- Do NOT introduce new filters in this pass.

4) RESPONSIVE RULES
- On mobile:
  - Keep the club movement row on one line if possible; otherwise allow wrap but keep crests attached to names.
  - Keep spacing tight but readable.
  - Ensure chips/badges don’t overflow.

5) COPY / MESSAGING
- Make the page subtitle more explicit:
  - Change to: “Rumours and confirmed moves — updated daily”
- Ensure “Loan” and “Permanent” are the only deal-type labels (no duplicates elsewhere).

6) CLEANUP CONSISTENCY
- There must be ONE place for:
  - Status (Confirmed/Rumour)
  - Deal type (Loan/Permanent)
  - Value/fee
  - Date
  - Confidence (rumours only)
  - Source
- Remove any duplicated pills like “Official” floating elsewhere (fold into the status badge text as described).

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the redesign in code.
- Update/replace the existing TransferCard component accordingly.
- Ensure no lint/type errors.
- Confirm the page looks correct with both rumour and confirmed dummy data.

After implementing, briefly describe:
- What changed (bullet list)
- Any assumptions about crest file paths and how to add crests later.
