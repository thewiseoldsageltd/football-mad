You are working in the Football Mad Replit project.

Goal
On MOBILE only, shorten EntityPill labels for competitions + teams (e.g. [EPL] [ARS] [CHE]) while keeping full names on desktop/tablet. Keep accessibility: screen readers should still get the full entity name.

Implement with minimal risk:
- Extend the shared EntityPill component so it can optionally render a short label on small screens.
- Compute short codes for Team + Competition pills (prefer real codes from data if present; otherwise fallback).
- Apply this to the Article page header pills AND the “In this article” section.

Requirements
1) Update `client/src/components/entity-pill.tsx`
   - Add optional props:
     - `shortLabel?: string`
     - `responsiveLabel?: boolean` (default true when shortLabel is provided)
   - Rendering:
     - If `responsiveLabel && shortLabel`:
       - On small screens (<md): show `shortLabel`
       - On md+: show `entity.name`
     - Always set `title={entity.name}` and `aria-label={entity.name}` on the link/button wrapper.
     - Don’t change styling/layout otherwise (keep current pill sizing).
   - Example pattern:
     - `<span className="md:hidden">{shortLabel}</span>`
     - `<span className="hidden md:inline">{entity.name}</span>`
     - If no shortLabel, just render `entity.name` as today.

2) Update `client/src/pages/article.tsx`
   - Wherever you build the pill arrays (competitionPills, team pills, etc), add `shortLabel` values for:
     a) Teams:
        - Prefer any existing code/shortCode fields already available from backend entities if present (e.g. `team.shortCode`, `team.code`, `team.abbr` etc)
        - Else fallback to:
          - If name contains spaces, use first letter of first 3 words (e.g. “Manchester City” => “MCI”)
          - Else take first 3 letters uppercased (e.g. “Arsenal” => “ARS”)
     b) Competitions:
        - Add a small mapping for common comps (keep it local in article.tsx):
          - “Premier League” => “EPL”
          - “Championship” => “EFL”
          - “League One” => “L1”
          - “League Two” => “L2”
          - “Carabao Cup” => “CC”
          - “FA Cup” => “FAC”
          - “Champions League” => “UCL”
          - “Europa League” => “UEL”
          - “Conference League” => “UECL”
        - Fallback if not in map: create a 3–4 char acronym from first letters of words (ignore “the”, “and”, “of”)
   - Attach the computed shortLabel onto the `EntityData` you pass into EntityPill (you can extend the local `EntityData` type to include `shortLabel?: string` without breaking other uses).
   - When rendering EntityPill for competition/team pills (header + “In this article”), pass:
     - `shortLabel={entity.shortLabel}`
     - `responsiveLabel={true}`
   - Do NOT shorten Player/Manager names on mobile (keep full names).

3) Verify
   - Desktop: pills show full names exactly as now.
   - Mobile:
     - Header pills show e.g. EPL / ARS / CHE
     - “In this article” competition + teams show short codes
     - Players remain full names
   - Hover/links still work, titles show full names.

4) Keep changes scoped
   - Only touch `entity-pill.tsx` and `article.tsx` unless TypeScript forces a tiny shared type tweak.
   - No visual redesign; just label text switching.

After implementation, add a quick `console.debug` (temporary) in article.tsx that logs computed shortLabels for header pills, then remove it before finishing.

Make the changes now. Do NOT run end-to-end/regression tests. No video generation.
