You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Next.js/React + Tailwind). Update the GLOBAL Transfers page to follow this structure:

GOAL
Create a gold-standard Transfers experience with three sub-tabs:
- All (blended feed)
- Rumours
- Confirmed

Rules:
1) Keep the existing sub-navigation UI style (left aligned tabs with totals in brackets).
2) Add a new “Confirmed” tab (if not already present).
3) Implement data model + rendering so that:
   - Rumours are shown as “rumour cards” (existing UI can stay)
   - Confirmed transfers are shown as a clean “ledger” list/card style
4) “All” tab should be a blended feed with this ordering:
   a) Confirmed transfers first (newest first)
   b) Then rumours sorted by confidence (highest first), with newest as secondary
5) “Rumours” tab: only rumours (existing cards)
6) “Confirmed” tab: only confirmed transfers (ledger format)

DATA
For now, use dummy data in-page (or in a small local module) with two arrays:
- rumours[]
- confirmedTransfers[]
Ensure the data shape is future-proof so we can later replace confirmedTransfers with FPL feed results.

Recommended TypeScript shapes:

type TransferRumour = {
  id: string;
  playerName: string;
  position?: string; // e.g. "MID"
  fromClub: string;
  toClub: string;
  feeText?: string; // e.g. "£52m" or "Loan"
  confidence?: number; // 0-100
  tier?: "Tier A" | "Tier B" | "Tier C";
  statusLabel?: "Rumour"; // default
  sourceLabel?: string; // e.g. "The Athletic"
  updatedAt: string; // ISO date
};

type ConfirmedTransfer = {
  id: string;
  playerName: string;
  position?: string;
  fromClub: string;
  toClub: string;
  moveType: "Permanent" | "Loan" | "Free";
  feeText?: string; // if known
  confirmedAt: string; // ISO date
  sourceType: "FPL" | "Official";
};

UI REQUIREMENTS
A) Confirmed transfer “ledger” item/card should show:
   - Player name (+ optional position chip)
   - From → To row
   - MoveType chip (Permanent/Loan/Free)
   - Fee text if present
   - Confirmed date (e.g. “15 Jan 2026”)
   - SourceType chip (“FPL” or “Official”)

B) Rumour cards can remain as-is BUT ensure:
   - confidence shown if available (bar or %)
   - tier chip kept
   - source label shown

COUNTS (TAB TOTALS)
- All (X) where X = rumours.length + confirmedTransfers.length
- Rumours (X) = rumours.length
- Confirmed (X) = confirmedTransfers.length

FILTER DROPDOWN (DESKTOP)
Keep the right-aligned “All Teams” dropdown filter on the global Transfers page.
For now it can be a UI-only dropdown with options:
- All Teams
- Arsenal
- Chelsea
- Liverpool
…but structure the code so it can later filter both rumours and confirmed lists by toClub or fromClub.
If filtering is implemented now, do it for both arrays consistently.

SORTING
- Confirmed: sort by confirmedAt desc
- Rumours: sort by confidence desc (missing confidence treated as 0), then updatedAt desc

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1) Locate the global Transfers page component (e.g. /app/transfers/page.tsx or /pages/transfers.tsx).
2) Refactor so there is a shared dataset computed for each tab:
   - visibleRumours
   - visibleConfirmed
   - visibleAllFeed (merged array with a discriminant field like kind: "confirmed" | "rumour")
3) Create small components if helpful:
   - <ConfirmedTransferCard />
   - <RumourTransferCard /> (use existing if already present)
4) Match existing Football Mad styling:
   - rounded cards, soft borders, subtle shadows, spacing consistent with other pages
   - keep typography consistent (headings, muted descriptions, etc.)
5) Ensure it works on mobile:
   - tabs scroll horizontally if needed
   - filter dropdown becomes full-width and centered text (as per our site convention)
   - no layout breaks

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Tabs: All / Rumours / Confirmed render with correct counts
- All tab shows confirmed first, then rumours sorted properly
- Confirmed tab shows ledger cards with required fields + chips
- Rumours tab unchanged in styling but filtered
- Filter dropdown present and does not break layout on mobile
- No TypeScript errors, no lint errors

After implementing, briefly list what files you changed and where the dummy data lives.
