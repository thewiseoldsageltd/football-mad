Refactor the Predicted Lineups section into a “locked” 3-column layout where the pitch can’t grow and break the card’s compactness.

Layout requirements

Make the whole Predicted Lineups card a 3-column grid on desktop:

[Home XI list] [Pitch] [Away XI list]

Each column must be equal height and sit within the same card.

The middle pitch must be constrained to the card height (no growing taller than the lists).

Set a single max height for the module (e.g. max-h-[520px] on desktop, responsive) and make only the lists scroll internally if content exceeds height:

Home list column: overflow-y-auto

Away list column: overflow-y-auto

Pitch column: h-full and overflow-hidden (no scroll)

Pitch sizing:

Pitch should fill the middle column: w-full h-full

Use object-contain / aspect-[3/5] (portrait) so it scales to fit without distortion.

Ensure the pitch does NOT push substitutes down; it must stay inside the fixed-height module.

List styling requirements (visual boundaries)

Home XI list (left column):

Left aligned text

Shirt numbers form the left visual boundary: number first, then player name.

Use tabular-nums and a fixed width for numbers (w-6 text-left tabular-nums).

Away XI list (right column):

Right aligned text

Shirt numbers form the right visual boundary: player name first, then number on the far right.

Use tabular-nums and a fixed width for numbers (w-6 text-right tabular-nums).

Substitutes placement

Keep substitutes visible but compact:

Place substitutes as a small footer area inside each list column (below XI) but still within the same fixed-height column.

If needed, make the whole list column scroll (XI + subs together) so the card height stays fixed.

Responsive (mobile)

Mobile layout:

First row: a single “combined” card with [Home XI | Away XI] side by side (two columns).

Second row: Pitch view below (w-full) with a reasonable fixed height (e.g. h-[420px]) and object-contain.

Ensure the pitch rendering still strictly separates home players (top half) and away players (bottom half), and avoid any team mixing.
