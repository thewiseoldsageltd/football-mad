Replit AI — please update the Champions League (Tables > Europe) standings on MOBILE to match the exact same “trimmed + expandable row” UI we already use for Tables > Leagues (e.g. Premier League).

Goal:
- On small screens, Champions League standings must NOT render the full desktop table.
- It should render the SAME mobile standings component/pattern as Premier League:
  - Collapsed row shows: Pos | Team | Pts | chevron
  - Expanding reveals: P, W/D/L, GF/GA, GD, Form (exact same layout/typography as PL mobile)
  - Preserve the existing zone colouring/indicator logic (Top 8 / 9–24 / 25+) in a way consistent with PL mobile (e.g. left border/stripe or row tint — whichever PL uses).

Where to change:
- client/src/components/tables/europe-progress.tsx (Champions League Europe tab UI)
- DO NOT change the backend.

Implementation steps:
1) Find the exact mobile league table component currently used on Tables > Leagues (Premier League).
   - Search in client/src/components (and client/src/pages if needed) for the Premier League standings render.
   - Look for a component that renders the collapsed “Pos / Team / Pts” row with a chevron, and expands to show:
     - P:
     - W/D/L:
     - GF/GA:
     - GD:
     - Form:
   - This is the component/pattern we must reuse (or copy 1:1) so Europe behaves identically.

2) Reuse that existing mobile component for Champions League standings.
   - If the PL standings page uses a shared component like <MobileStandingsTable />, <StandingsMobile />, <LeagueTableMobile />, etc:
     - Import it into europe-progress.tsx and pass Champions League standings data into it.
   - If it’s not a reusable component and is embedded inline:
     - Extract it into a shared component (preferred), then use it in BOTH places OR clone it into europe-progress.tsx without altering behaviour.

3) Data mapping (very important):
   - Map the UCL standings row fields into the exact shape the mobile component expects:
     - pos / rank
     - team name (and badge if the PL view shows it)
     - points
     - played
     - won, drawn, lost
     - goalsFor, goalsAgainst
     - goalDiff
     - form (whatever format the PL mobile uses; if it expects an array of W/D/L, convert accordingly)
   - Ensure null safety: don’t assume any field exists without fallback.

4) Responsive behaviour must match Premier League:
   - On mobile (same breakpoint as PL), show ONLY the mobile trimmed table.
   - On md+ (desktop/tablet), keep the existing full standings table that Europe currently shows.
   - Implement with the same Tailwind approach used in PL (e.g. hidden md:block / md:hidden) so we don’t introduce a new breakpoint style.

5) Keep the rest of the Europe page unchanged:
   - Fixtures panel and matchday buttons remain exactly as-is.
   - No layout regressions.

Acceptance checks:
- iPhone width: Champions League standings looks identical in structure to Premier League standings (collapsed rows + expand for details + form).
- Points column is visible without horizontal scrolling.
- Team names are less likely to wrap (because we’re no longer forcing the full desktop table).
- Desktop remains unchanged.

Deliverable:
- Commit the changes with a clear message like:
  “Europe UCL: use existing mobile standings UI (trimmed + expandable) like PL”
