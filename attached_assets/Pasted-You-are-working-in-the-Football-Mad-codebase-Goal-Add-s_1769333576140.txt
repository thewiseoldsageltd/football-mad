You are working in the Football Mad codebase.

Goal: Add standings support for 4 “Big Euro” leagues on the Tables page:
- La Liga (Spain)
- Serie A (Italy)
- Bundesliga (Germany)
- Ligue 1 (France)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT guess Goalserve league IDs.
- Use the existing competitions search endpoint to discover IDs:
  GET /api/dev/competitions/search?q=<query>&country=<country>
- Then update client/src/lib/league-config.ts with the discovered goalserveLeagueId for each league.

Domain to use in verification commands:
https://f04e3e83-5dee-4d43-ba21-fba6506a8e19-00-3rjffbqt7u6wn.spock.replit.dev

Tasks:

1) Find the correct Goalserve IDs (do this first)
Run curl calls (or use server code knowledge) against:
  - /api/dev/competitions/search?q=la%20liga&country=spain
  - /api/dev/competitions/search?q=primera&country=spain
  - /api/dev/competitions/search?q=serie%20a&country=italy
  - /api/dev/competitions/search?q=bundesliga&country=germany
  - /api/dev/competitions/search?q=ligue%201&country=france
Pick the top-level main leagues (not cups, not B teams, not youth, not women).

2) Update league config
File: client/src/lib/league-config.ts
- Ensure these leagues exist as configs (slug/name/shortName):
  - la-liga / La Liga / LL
  - serie-a / Serie A / SA
  - bundesliga / Bundesliga / BUN
  - ligue-1 / Ligue 1 / L1
- Set goalserveLeagueId to the discovered value for each.
- Add standingsZones for each league (config-driven highlighting):
  Use “Euro default” zones for now (easy to tweak later):
    - Champions League: positions 1-4
    - Europa League: position 5
    - Conference League: position 6
    - Relegation: bottom 3 (or bottom 2 for Bundesliga if appropriate)
  NOTE: If you’re unsure for a league, set Relegation conservatively (bottom 3) and add a TODO comment.
  Zone objects should match the existing StandingsZone type and render cleanly in the legend.

3) Ensure the Tables UI shows them
File: client/src/data/tables-mock.ts
- Make sure these tabs exist (id must match slug):
  - la-liga
  - serie-a
  - bundesliga
  - ligue-1

4) Build log
File: docs/BUILD_LOG.md
- Add a short section: “Big Euro Leagues Standings”
- Record the final Goalserve IDs discovered.

5) Verification commands (print these at the end)
Provide commands for each league using the domain above:
A) Purge
POST /api/jobs/purge-standings?leagueId=<ID>&season=2025/2026
B) Force ingest
POST /api/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings?leagueId=<ID>&force=1
C) Fetch snapshot
GET /api/standings?leagueId=<ID>&season=2025/2026

Use GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET header where required.

Acceptance:
- Each league appears on /tables and loads data after ingest.
- No team names render as numeric IDs.
- Legends render from standingsZones with short labels (keep them compact where possible).
