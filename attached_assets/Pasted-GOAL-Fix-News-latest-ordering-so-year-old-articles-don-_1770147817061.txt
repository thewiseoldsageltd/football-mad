GOAL: Fix News “latest” ordering so year-old articles don’t appear in the latest feed just because they were ingested/updated recently. Do NOT run regression tests or E2E.

PROBLEM:
The News UI shows “about 1 year ago” items mixed into the latest feed and flickers/reverts. This happens because the API ordering uses:
freshnessTs = COALESCE(sourceUpdatedAt, updatedAt, publishedAt, createdAt)
Many older Ghost posts have sourceUpdatedAt = null, and our DB updatedAt was set to new Date() during ingest, making them appear “fresh” and pushing them into the top results.

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
1) server/storage.ts: Remove DB updatedAt from the freshness ordering for news.
   - Change freshness timestamp to:
     COALESCE(sourceUpdatedAt, publishedAt, createdAt)
   - Apply this to both getNewsArticles and getNewsUpdates ordering + cursor logic.
   - nextCursor should be based on sourceUpdatedAt first, else publishedAt, else createdAt (NOT updatedAt).

2) server/routes.ts (Ghost sync): Ensure sourceUpdatedAt is ALWAYS set on both insert and update paths.
   - Compute:
     const ghostSourceUpdatedAt = ghostPost.updated_at ? new Date(ghostPost.updated_at)
       : ghostPost.published_at ? new Date(ghostPost.published_at)
       : ghostPost.created_at ? new Date(ghostPost.created_at)
       : new Date();
   - Persist:
     sourceUpdatedAt: ghostSourceUpdatedAt
     updatedAt: ghostSourceUpdatedAt   (ok, but ordering must no longer depend on updatedAt)
   - Make sure there are NO remaining Ghost-post upsert paths that leave sourceUpdatedAt null.

3) client/src/pages/news.tsx: Ensure merge comparison uses:
   sourceUpdatedAt || publishedAt || createdAt
   (updatedAt should be last-resort or removed for news freshness comparisons)

4) Do not modify polling interval in this prompt.
5) Do not run tests, regression, or E2E. Manual verification only.

MANUAL VERIFICATION:
- In Ghost: edit a recently published post title and confirm:
  - Ghost updated_at changes
  - DB /api/news shows updated title within webhook/sweeper/poll window
- Confirm the “latest” feed no longer includes posts from 2024 unless their Ghost updated_at is genuinely recent.
