We need to build Matchday Pages (V1) for Football Mad in our React/Next.js app.

Context:

We already have Team Hub → Matches working (month-based list) and each match row is clickable with a chevron.

Clicking a match should navigate to a matchday page.

Matchday pages must support two states:

Pre-match (fixture-oriented)

Post-match (result-oriented)

We have an injury system already (FPL-powered) and want match pages to be fan-first and narrative-first.

Requirements:

Routing

Create a matchday route like /matches/[matchId] (or align with existing routes if already started).

The match row click should navigate to this matchday page using the match’s id.

Shared Match Header (Always visible at top)

Home crest + Away crest

Team names

Kick-off time (pre-match) OR final score (post-match)

Competition + round (where available)

Stadium + date

Status badge: “Today”, “FT”, “Postponed” (live can be placeholder for later)

Pre-match Mode (fixture)

Show a short match narrative (2–3 sentences) at the top under the header (dummy copy is fine).

Show a Predicted XI (basic) section:

formation label (e.g. 4-3-3)

list of likely starters (simple list is fine for V1)

Show Key absences pulling from our injury availability data if available (fallback to dummy data).

Show a light Head-to-head snippet (last 3–5 meetings) using dummy data.

Post-match Mode (result)

Replace narrative with a short match summary (2–3 sentences) (dummy copy ok).

Show a Key moments timeline (goals, red cards, notable incidents) (dummy data ok).

Show Key stats (keep it curated to 4–5 stats max: xG, shots on target, possession, big chances, etc.) using dummy data for now.

Show a What this means section (league/cup implications in 1–2 lines) (dummy data ok).

Data

Use dummy matchday data initially, but structure it so it can later be powered by:

FPL fixtures/results for Premier League

another provider for cups/Europe

Keep the match model/provider-agnostic (fixture/result status should drive which mode renders).

Ensure null-safe rendering (no broken UI if optional data is missing).

UI/UX

Mobile-first, clean, scannable layout.

Use the existing Football Mad design language (cards, spacing, typography, right rail stays as-is where applicable).

Do not refactor other Team Hub tabs (Latest/Injuries/Transfers).

Deliverable:

Implement the matchday page with both modes working.

Make sure clicking a match row in Team Hub opens the matchday page.

Use solid dummy data so the page feels “real” even before live feeds are wired in.
