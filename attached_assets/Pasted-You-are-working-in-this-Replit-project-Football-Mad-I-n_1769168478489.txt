You are working in this Replit project (Football Mad). I need you to fix the Matches page UX + data plumbing WITHOUT me manually editing files. Please implement the changes end-to-end and keep the UI working in both desktop + mobile.

GOALS
1) Date navigation must actually load fixtures for the selected date (currently “next day” shows 0 and the UI still says Today).
2) Desktop layout: all controls in ONE line (tabs + date nav + competition + sort). Mobile: stacked neatly.
3) Fixture ordering: prioritise UK leagues first, then “big 5” Europe, then everything else (still show everything).
4) Competition badge: keep the small flag icon + league name (no emoji, no “[id]”, no “(Country)” text).
5) Keep competition filter working (uses goalserveCompetitionId), and sort by kick-off time (default). Remove team search from this page.

BACKEND CHANGES (Express routes)
A) Add a new endpoint that is date-driven (this is the root fix):
GET /api/matches/day
Query params:
- date=YYYY-MM-DD (required)
- status=all|live|scheduled|fulltime (default all)
- competitionId=<goalserveCompetitionId> (optional)

Behavior:
- Compute start/end for that date in UTC day boundaries:
  start = date + "T00:00:00.000Z"
  end   = date + "T23:59:59.999Z"
- Filter matches.kickoff_time BETWEEN start and end (inclusive).
- Apply status filtering:
  - fulltime: LOWER(status) in FINISHED_STATUSES
  - live: LOWER(status) in LIVE_STATUSES OR numeric minute status
  - scheduled: exclude live + finished (or keep “scheduled” plus other pre-match states)
  - all: no status filter (but still within date window)
- Apply competitionId filter using matches.goalserve_competition_id
- Always ORDER BY kickoff_time asc (base ordering), but also return enough fields for client-side priority sorting.

B) Ensure the response shape includes:
id, slug, kickoffTime, status, homeScore, awayScore, venue, competition, goalserveCompetitionId,
homeTeam (mapped or nameFromRaw), awayTeam (mapped or nameFromRaw)

C) Do NOT break the existing endpoints; just add this new one and use it from the UI.

FRONTEND CHANGES (Matches page)
D) Replace current data fetching on Matches page to use /api/matches/day with the selected date + status tab + competitionId.
- Selected date defaults to today (user’s local date).
- Prev/Next buttons shift selected date by -1/+1 day.
- A “Today” button jumps back to today and is visually active only when selected date is today.
- The date label should be:
  - If selected date is today: “Today — Fri 23 Jan”
  - Otherwise: “Sat 24 Jan 2026” (no “Today” word).

E) Fix the “next day shows 0 matches” bug by ensuring the query actually uses the selected date (not now-based windows).

F) Desktop layout:
- Row 1 (single line): Tabs (All/Live/Scheduled/Full-time) on the left, then Date nav cluster, then Competition dropdown, then Sort dropdown.
- No second-line “Show: 7/14/30” controls. Remove those.
- Remove team search from this page entirely.

G) Mobile layout:
- Tabs on top (scrollable if needed).
- Date nav row.
- Competition + sort row stacked.

PRIORITY ORDERING (client-side, safe + quick)
H) Implement a priority score for competitions, then sort within the selected day:
- UK top priority (in this order): Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two, National League, FA Cup, EFL Cup.
- Next priority: La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Eredivisie, Champions League, Europa League, Conference League.
- Everything else after.
Implementation detail:
- Use goalserveCompetitionId if possible (preferred), otherwise fallback to competition name matching.
- Keep kick-off time ordering within the same priority band.
So final sort: (priorityScore asc, kickoffTime asc).

FLAG ICONS + COMPETITION NAME CLEANUP
I) In the competition badge and competition dropdown:
- Show a small flag IMAGE (not emoji).
- Remove “(Country)” and “[1234]” from display.
- Keep the underlying filter value as goalserveCompetitionId.
Implementation idea:
- Parse competition strings like:
  - "Catarinense (Brazil) [1140]" => name="Catarinense", country="Brazil", id="1140"
  - "Premier League (Jamaica) [1270]" => name="Premier League", country="Jamaica", id="1270"
  - "Libya: Premier League" => country="Libya", name="Premier League"
- Maintain a small mapping from country name -> ISO2 and use a flag CDN image URL.
- If unknown country, show a neutral globe icon.

VENUE / STADIUM
J) If venue exists in the match record, show it subtly on the card (small text under date/time). If venue is null, show nothing (don’t invent).

DELIVERABLES
1) Implement the new backend endpoint /api/matches/day
2) Update Matches page to use it, fix date nav + layout, remove 7/14/30 + team search
3) Add priority ordering (UK + big Europe first)
4) Ensure competition dropdown is not duplicated and uses clean labels + flag images
5) Quick verification steps:
- curl a specific day: /api/matches/day?date=2026-01-23&status=all
- click next/prev day and confirm matches load
- confirm UK leagues appear at top when present
- competition filter works and shows clean names + flags

Please make the smallest clean set of changes across the relevant files and keep TypeScript types correct.
