You are working in the Football Mad Replit project.

Goal: Improve Tables > Europe > Champions League matchday UX:
1) Extend the Matchday selector beyond MD1–MD8 to include knockout stages:
   - MD1–MD8
   - PO (Knockout Play-offs)
   - L16 (Round of 16)
   - QF (Quarter-finals)
   - SF (Semi-finals)
   - Final (one long pill that spans the full row width on desktop)
   Keep the “rows of 6” layout for desktop.

2) In the fixture list on the right:
   - For past matchdays (anything before the current matchday), show RESULTS (scores + status pill like Full-Time / AET / Penalties).
   - For the current/upcoming matchday, keep date + kickoff time as it is now.
   - If a past match is missing scores, fall back to showing date/time.

Implementation details (do this without adding regression video testing):
A) Identify the Europe UI component (likely something like `client/src/components/tables/europe-progress.tsx` or similar) that renders:
   - the Matchday selector buttons
   - the right-hand “Matchday X” fixture list

B) Add stage-aware matchday options:
   - Introduce an array like:
     [
       { key: "MD1", label: "MD 1", type: "league", md: 1 },
       ...
       { key: "MD8", label: "MD 8", type: "league", md: 8 },
       { key: "PO",  label: "PO",   type: "ko",  round: "Knockout Play-offs" },
       { key: "L16", label: "L16",  type: "ko",  round: "Round of 16" },
       { key: "QF",  label: "QF",   type: "ko",  round: "Quarter-finals" },
       { key: "SF",  label: "SF",   type: "ko",  round: "Semi-finals" },
       { key: "F",   label: "Final",type: "ko",  round: "Final", isFinalPill: true }
     ]
   - Render them in the existing grid (6 columns on desktop).
   - For the Final button, make it span all 6 columns (e.g. `col-span-6`) and render label “Final”.

C) Wire selector state:
   - When a league MD is selected: show fixtures for that matchday from the league-phase matchday data (same as today).
   - When a KO option is selected: show fixtures from the knockout data for that round (you already parse and expose knockout rounds from the backend endpoint).
   - If a KO round has multiple legs/dates, just list all matches in that round in the same right-hand list.

D) Determine “current matchday”:
   - Compute `currentMatchday` as the highest MD that has at least one match with status NOT “Not Started” (or has a FT/AET/PEN status / a score present).
   - If none started, currentMatchday = 1.

E) Past MD results display:
   - In the right-hand match list item component:
     - If `selected` is a league MD and `selectedMd < currentMatchday`, render:
       - Home team + away team (as now)
       - Scoreline: `homeScore - awayScore` (use FT score; if penalties present show brackets like you implemented in cups: `2 (4)` / `2 (3)` and status pill “Penalties”)
       - Status pill: Full-Time / AET / Penalties / Half-Time where applicable (reuse existing status-to-label mapping from cups if possible).
     - Else (selectedMd >= currentMatchday): keep date + kickoff time display.
     - If score fields are missing, fall back to date/time.

F) Keep styling consistent:
   - Reuse existing shadcn Button styling used for the current MatchdaySelector.
   - Don’t change the overall layout: left standings, right matchday selector + match list.

G) Add a tiny sanity check:
   - Ensure selecting PO/L16/QF/SF/Final does not break when knockout data is empty (show “No fixtures yet” message).

H) Update docs (short):
   - Add a note to docs/BUILD_LOG.md and docs/DECISIONS.md describing:
     - added KO stage pills to the matchday selector
     - past matchdays now show results
     - Final pill spans full row

After changes, quickly manual test:
- MD1 shows results (if started) or date/time if not
- MD8 shows upcoming fixtures with date/time
- PO/L16/QF/SF/Final tabs render and don’t crash even if empty
- Past MDs show scores + status pill when available
