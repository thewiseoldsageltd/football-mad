You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Next.js/React + Tailwind). Create a new main nav tab/page: TABLES. This is UI scaffolding only (no Goalserve integration yet) using mock data, but must be Goalserve-ready.

GOAL
Build a “Tables” section with the same navigation + filter conventions as the rest of the site:
- Desktop: sub-nav left aligned, filters right aligned, grey sub-nav bar with lozenge active tab
- Mobile: sub-nav scrollable left→right, centre-aligned filter stack, right-side fade only (no left fade at initial state)

ROUTE / FILES
- Create: `app/tables/page.tsx`
- Add components under: `components/tables/*`
- Ensure main navigation includes “Tables” as a top-level tab linking to `/tables`

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (TABLES)
Top-level sub-navigation within Tables (type-first):
- Leagues
- Cups
- Europe

When “Leagues” is active:
- Show a second-level competition sub-navigation (same style) with these items:
  All | Premier League | Championship | League One | La Liga | Serie A | Bundesliga | Ligue 1
- Default selection: “All”
- “All” can just show Premier League table for now (placeholder) but keep the structure for later.

When “Europe” is active:
- Second-level sub-navigation:
  Champions League | Europa League | Conference League
- Default: Champions League

When “Cups” is active:
- Second-level sub-navigation:
  FA Cup | EFL Cup | Copa del Rey | DFB-Pokal | Coppa Italia
- Default: FA Cup
- For Cups v1, show a simple “Round list” placeholder component (no bracket yet).

DESKTOP LAYOUT RULES
1) Page header:
- Title: “Tables”
- Subtitle: “League standings and tournament progress”

2) Sub-navigation row:
- Left: Tables top-level tabs (Leagues/Cups/Europe) + second-level competition tabs (where applicable)
- Right: Filters aligned right (see below)
- Use the same grey background container + lozenge active styling used on Injuries/Matches/News

3) Filters (right aligned, desktop):
- Season dropdown (default “2025/26”)
- Optional “View” dropdown for tables: “Overall” | “Home” | “Away” (can be UI-only for now)
- These do not need to function fully yet, but UI must exist and match other filter styling.

MOBILE LAYOUT RULES
- Top-level + second-level sub-nav must be horizontally scrollable.
- Show only right-side fade at initial state (no left fade until user scrolls).
- Filters on mobile are full-width stacked and center-aligned text (consistent with Matches/Injuries):
  Season dropdown (full width)
  View dropdown (full width)
- No autofocus on any inputs.

TABLE UI (LEAGUES)
Create a reusable `LeagueTable` component that renders a clean standings table.
Columns (desktop):
- Pos
- Team (crest/initial avatar + team name)
- P
- GD
- Pts

Columns (mobile):
- Pos
- Team
- Pts
(with a compact secondary line or hidden columns; keep it readable)

Row styling:
- Subtle separators, compact but readable.
- Optional restrained highlights:
  - Top 4 (Champions League) = subtle left border highlight
  - Bottom 3 (relegation) = subtle left border highlight
(keep subtle; no loud colors)

Use mock data:
- Provide a small mock table for Premier League and La Liga (10 teams each is enough).
Data fields per row:
`pos, teamName, played, gd, pts`

TEAM CRESTS (OPTIONAL FALLBACK)
- If you already have crest assets mapping, use them.
- Otherwise use a simple team initials circle/avatar.
Do not fetch external images.

EUROPE UI (GROUPS + KNOCKOUT PLACEHOLDER)
- For Champions League/Europa/Conference:
  - Show a “Group Stage” toggle and “Knockout” toggle (UI only).
  - For “Group Stage” display a group selector (Group A, Group B) and reuse the `LeagueTable` component.
  - For “Knockout” display a placeholder “Rounds list” (R16, QF, SF, Final) with dummy fixtures/results text.

CUPS UI (ROUND LIST PLACEHOLDER)
- Show a simple vertical list of rounds (Third Round, Fourth Round, etc.) with dummy text.
- Keep it clean and consistent with site cards.

BEHAVIOUR (CLIENT-SIDE STATE OK)
- Tabs switch content instantly (no page reload).
- Default state on /tables:
  - Top-level: Leagues
  - Second-level: All
  - Season: 2025/26
  - View: Overall
- Keep null-safe rendering everywhere.

DELIVERABLES
- New Tables page that looks production-ready with mock data.
- Components:
  - `TablesTopTabs`
  - `TablesCompetitionTabs` (second-level)
  - `TablesFilters`
  - `LeagueTable`
  - `RoundsList` (for Cups/Knockout placeholders)
  - `GroupSelector` (for Europe group stage)
- No console errors, no TypeScript errors.

After implementation, briefly list the files created/updated and where mock data lives.
