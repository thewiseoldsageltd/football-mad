You are working in a Replit TypeScript + React app.

Goal: Clean up the Matches page UX to match Soccerway-style navigation and remove confusing filters.

Please implement the following changes (NO guesses, keep changes minimal and consistent with existing shadcn/ui patterns):

A) Matches page navigation
1) Replace the current top tabs (Today/Tomorrow/This Week/Results) with status tabs:
   - All
   - Live
   - Scheduled
   - Full-time
   These tabs should filter which endpoint we call (or which results we show) based on status.

2) Add a date picker control (single day is fine to start) with default = today (local user time).
   - The date picker controls the fixtures/results window.
   - Remove the 7/14/30 day buttons entirely.

3) Remove the “Search team…” input from the Matches page UI (we will rely on team hub pages for team-specific fixture browsing).

B) API usage (keep backend unchanged unless absolutely required)
1) For “Scheduled” and “All”, fetch from: GET /api/matches/fixtures
   - Add query params that represent the selected date.
   - If the backend only supports days today, implement a simple mapping:
     - selectedDate = today => days=1
     - selectedDate = tomorrow => days=2 and then client-filter to tomorrow only
     - Otherwise use a small range (days=7) and client-filter to selected date.
   Keep it reliable and avoid huge payloads.

2) For “Full-time”, fetch from: GET /api/matches/results
   - Use the same date selection approach.

3) For “Live”, fetch from: GET /api/matches/live

C) Competition dropdown cleanup
1) Ensure there is only ONE competition dropdown on the page.
2) Keep it inline in the same row as the date picker and sort control (not pushed to a second line).
3) Competition dropdown values should NOT show the [id] suffix.
   Example: show “Catarinense” not “Catarinense (Brazil) [1140]”.
   Also remove “(Country)” from the label if we’re showing a flag (see below).

D) Replace emoji flags with proper flag icons
1) Replace emoji flags in competition pills with a small flag icon badge (rounded square or circle, ~16–18px).
2) Implement a helper that maps country names from competition strings to ISO2 codes and uses flagcdn:
   - URL format: https://flagcdn.com/w20/{iso2}.png (lowercase)
3) If country is unknown, show a neutral globe icon badge instead.

E) Fixture card enhancements (only if data exists)
1) If the API response includes venue (match.venue), display it subtly under the date/time line.
2) If venue is null/undefined, do not render the venue row.

Implementation notes:
- Make changes in client/src/pages/matches.tsx and only touch other components if required to remove duplicated UI.
- Keep styling consistent with existing components.
- Do not add new heavy dependencies.
- After changes, the page should show “All/Scheduled/Full-time/Live” tabs, date picker, competition dropdown, sort dropdown, and the fixture list.

When finished:
- Provide a short summary of files changed and how to test manually in the browser.
