PROMPT — Matches page finishing polish (remove debug, clarify sort label, prioritise competition dropdown, fix 1-game desktop layout)

Context
- Football Mad Matches page
- Debug banner was added to verify backend order; grouping bug fixed by grouping with goalserveCompetitionId and preserving server order via Map.
- Now we want UI polish:
  1) Remove debug banner
  2) Rename the sort dropdown label so it doesn’t clash with “All competitions”
  3) Apply the same priority logic to the “All competitions” dropdown ordering (Tier 0/Tier 1/Tier 2 then alphabetical)
  4) Handle desktop 2-column layout when there’s only one match (avoid awkward empty column)

Tasks

A) Remove the debug banner (DEV DEBUG)
- In client/src/pages/matches.tsx remove the “DEV DEBUG – API Ordering Check” banner entirely.
- Remove any related useMemo/consts used only for that banner (e.g., debugInfo, isDev).
- Ensure no debug UI renders in any environment.

B) Rename “Competition” sort dropdown label to avoid clash with “All competitions”
- Keep the sort dropdown functionality (competition vs kickoff).
- Change the displayed placeholder/label from “Competition” to “Sort by” (preferred) or “Order by”.
- Options should read:
  - “Sort by: Competition”
  - “Sort by: Kick-off time”
  (Or equivalent, but make it obvious this is sorting, not filtering.)
- Ensure the filter dropdown remains “All competitions” and is clearly a filter.

C) Prioritise the “All competitions” dropdown using the same tier logic as match ordering
Goal
- The competition filter list should not be purely alphabetical; it should surface Tier 0 leagues first, then Tier 1, Tier 2, then everything else alphabetical.
- Keep “All competitions” at the top.

Implementation detail
- Build the competition list from matchesData (unique competitions), using goalserveCompetitionId as the unique key.
- For each competition option, compute a sortKey using the SAME parsing + priority logic as the backend:
  - Use rawCompetition if present; else use competition string.
  - Parse “League (Country)” and “UEFA …” correctly.
  - Produce a leagueKey like `england|championship`, `uefa|europa league`, etc.
  - Assign a numeric priority (Tier 0 first, Tier 1, Tier 2, then default 1000, youth/reserve 9000).
- Then sort competition options by:
  1) priority asc
  2) display name asc (within same priority)
- IMPORTANT: disambiguate duplicate display names in the dropdown the same way we do in the match badges:
  - If two competitions share the same display name, show “Name (Country)” for both.
  - But if already “Name (Country)” don’t double-wrap.

Where to implement
- Whatever file currently builds the competition dropdown options (likely matches.tsx or MatchesFilters component).
- Keep it local to the Matches page for now (no premature abstraction), but avoid duplicating logic if there’s already a client helper.

D) Desktop layout when only one match is playing
Goal
- If a competition group has only 1 match, it should render as a single full-width card (not a 2-column grid with an empty gap).
- If there are 2+ matches, keep the 2-column grid on desktop.
- On mobile remain single column always.

Implementation suggestion
- In the component that renders match cards for a group:
  - If groupMatches.length === 1:
    - render a single card inside a full-width container
  - else:
    - render grid with md:grid-cols-2 (or equivalent)
- Ensure spacing stays consistent between groups.

Acceptance checks
- No debug banner visible.
- Sort dropdown label reads “Sort by” (or “Order by”) and doesn’t look like a competition filter.
- Competition filter dropdown shows Tier 0 (UEFA + England) first, then Big 5, then Scotland, then rest.
- Duplicate competition names are disambiguated in dropdown list.
- A competition day with only one match shows a single centred/full-width card on desktop with no empty column effect.

Notes
- Do NOT change backend endpoints or data ingest in this task; purely UI polish.
- Keep existing functionality working: tabs, date nav, competition filter, sort mode.
