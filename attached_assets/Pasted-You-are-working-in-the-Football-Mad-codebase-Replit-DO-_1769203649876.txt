You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Replit). DO NOT go into long test loops. Make ONLY the changes requested, run at most: `npm test` (or `pnpm test`) once if it’s fast, otherwise skip tests and do a quick manual check in the browser.

GOAL: Fix match-card alignment + mobile spacing + venue text corruption, without reworking unrelated UI.

-----------------------------
A) MATCH CARD LAYOUT (DESKTOP + MOBILE)
-----------------------------
Problem:
- We lost the clean horizontal alignment of: crest + team name + KO time + away name + away crest.
- Pills and long labels have been impacting name truncation.
- Mobile has inconsistent crest/name positioning and truncation.

Fix:
1) Update the match card component (where each fixture row is rendered — likely `EnhancedMatchCard.tsx` or similar) to use a stable CSS Grid layout with fixed columns.

DESKTOP (>= md):
- Use a single-row grid:
  [home crest] [home name] [center column] [away name] [away crest]
- Keep the KO time in the center column.
- Put the competition pill ABOVE the KO time in the center column but it must NOT push the whole card out of alignment. (It can be a small stacked column inside the center cell.)

Suggested grid:
- container: `grid items-center`
- columns (desktop): `grid-cols-[44px_minmax(0,1fr)_140px_minmax(0,1fr)_44px]`
- center cell: `flex flex-col items-center leading-none`
- home/away name: `truncate` and align toward the center:
  - home name: `text-right justify-self-end`
  - away name: `text-left justify-self-start`

MOBILE (< md):
- Still keep 5 columns, but tighten:
  - columns: `grid-cols-[44px_minmax(0,1fr)_96px_minmax(0,1fr)_44px]`
- Ensure the home/away names are aligned toward the KO time (home right-aligned, away left-aligned).
- Reduce pill width impact:
  - Pill should be SHORT: show flag + league name ONLY (NO country in brackets, NO “• England”, nothing).
  - If you still need disambiguation, only apply it in the competition FILTER dropdown, not on the card pill.

PILL RULE:
- Match card pill text = league name only (e.g., “Championship”, “Serie A”, “Bundesliga Women”).
- Flag already communicates country; do not append country text anywhere in the pill on cards.

2) Ensure away team name never overflows outside the card:
- Use `min-w-0` on the name containers and `truncate` on the text span.

3) Restore the “one fixture per row” everywhere (no 2-column fixture grid on desktop).
- If there’s a parent layout using `grid-cols-2` at lg, remove it so fixtures are a single vertical list.

-----------------------------
B) FAINT DIVIDER BETWEEN COMPETITIONS (DESKTOP AND MOBILE)
-----------------------------
Add a subtle divider between competition groups (not between every match).
- In the matches list grouping component (`MatchesList.tsx` or equivalent), when rendering groups, add a divider (e.g., `border-t border-gray-200/60 dark:border-white/10 my-6`) between groups.
- Keep spacing subtle; don’t add giant headers unless already present.

-----------------------------
C) MOBILE FILTERS: CENTER TEXT, ARROW RIGHT-ALIGNED
-----------------------------
For the mobile Filter/Sort dropdown triggers:
- Text should be centered.
- Chevron icon should be right-aligned (consistent with rest of site).
Implementation:
- Wrap trigger content in `relative w-full`
- Put the label in an absolutely centered span: `absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`
- Keep chevron in a right-side container: `absolute right-3`
- Ensure accessibility (button still works, label still present).

Also: mobile filters should remain stacked (Filter on top of Sort). If they became inline at any breakpoint, fix the container to:
- `flex flex-col gap-3 md:flex-row` (or similar), so only desktop becomes horizontal.

Closed-state labels:
- Keep closed state showing only “Filter by…” and “Sort by…” (no selected value in the trigger). Selection still applies; just don’t show it in the trigger label.

-----------------------------
D) VENUE / STADIUM NAME CORRUPTION
-----------------------------
We are seeing HTML entities like `&amp;apos;` in venue names on mobile.
Fix by decoding entities before rendering venue text.
- Add a small helper (no new heavy deps):
  - simplest safe approach: create a browser decode helper:
    `const decodeHtml = (s) => { const t=document.createElement('textarea'); t.innerHTML=s; return t.value; }`
- Apply it to venue/stadium strings (and any competition string if needed) right before rendering.
- Guard for null/undefined.

(If this runs server-side during SSR, avoid DOM. But this is a Vite SPA, so DOM is fine.)

-----------------------------
E) DO NOT DO ENDLESS TESTING
-----------------------------
After changes:
- Do a quick manual check in Preview on:
  - desktop width
  - mobile width
- Confirm:
  - alignment restored (crest+name inline with KO)
  - pill above KO but not ruining row alignment
  - no country text appended in pill
  - names truncate gracefully but show more characters than before
  - venue text no longer shows `&amp;apos;` corruption
  - faint dividers appear between competition groups
  - Filter/Sort triggers: centered label + chevron right, stacked on mobile

Deliverables:
- Show me the exact files changed and the key className/grid changes you made (brief).
- No refactors outside these components.
