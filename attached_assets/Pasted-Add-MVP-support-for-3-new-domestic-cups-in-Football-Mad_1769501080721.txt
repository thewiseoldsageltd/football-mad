Add MVP support for 3 new domestic cups in Football Mad:

- Scottish Cup (Goalserve: Scotland “FA Cup”) => competitionId 1371
- Scottish League Cup (Goalserve: Scotland “League Cup”) => competitionId 1372
- Coupe de France (Goalserve: France “France Cup”) => competitionId 1218

GOALS
1) Backend: /api/cup/progress?competitionId={1371|1372|1218} returns cup rounds + matches (kickoffDate/kickoffTime/status + penalties logic already in place).
2) Frontend: add these cups to Tables → Cups tabs so users can switch between them.
3) Round naming: do NOT “prettify” fraction labels into “Round of 64” etc. Mirror Goalserve labels by default. Only introduce a canonical ordering map if the round order is wrong.

BACKEND (server/routes.ts)
A) Add competition flags similar to other cups:
- isScottishCup: competitionId == "1371"
- isScottishLeagueCup: competitionId == "1372"
- isCoupeDeFrance: competitionId == "1218"

B) Ensure these competitions are treated as cups by the existing cup progress endpoint (same code path as FA Cup / Copa etc).
- If the endpoint currently only allows a fixed set of competitionIds, extend the allowlist to include 1371, 1372, 1218.

C) Ordering / seeding:
- First try with no new canonical mapping: keep Goalserve roundName strings as-is and sort using existing logic.
- If Coupe de France / Scottish cups come back in a weird order (e.g. 1/8-finals above 1/16-finals), add canonical round ordering that PRESERVES the label text:
  Example mapping keys like "1/64-finals", "1/32-finals", "1/16-finals", "1/8-finals", "Quarter-finals", "Semi-finals", "Final" etc, with numeric order values.
- Only seed empty rounds if the UI needs them (optional). Do not change other competitions.

FRONTEND (cup-config)
D) Add 3 cup entries where FA Cup / EFL Cup / DFB-Pokal etc are defined:
- Scottish Cup:
  slug: "scottish-cup"
  name: "Scottish Cup"
  shortName: "SCO"
  goalserveCompetitionId: "1371"
  country: "Scotland"
- Scottish League Cup:
  slug: "scottish-league-cup"
  name: "Scottish League Cup"
  shortName: "SLC"
  goalserveCompetitionId: "1372"
  country: "Scotland"
- Coupe de France:
  slug: "coupe-de-france"
  name: "Coupe de France"
  shortName: "CDF"
  goalserveCompetitionId: "1218"
  country: "France"

E) Make sure the Cups tab UI renders these alongside the existing cups and that selecting each triggers the correct API call using goalserveCompetitionId.

VALIDATION (run after)
1) curl and sanity check:
- /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1371
- /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1372
- /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1218
Confirm each returns rounds and matches.
2) Open Tables → Cups and confirm the 3 new tabs render and show fixtures.
3) Confirm penalties formatting and AET/Full-Time labels still work.

Make minimal changes. Do not regress existing cups.
