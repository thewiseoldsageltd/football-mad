UPDATE TEAM HUB v2 — REMOVE SHORTCODES + CLUB NEWSLETTER BRANDING

Context:
On Team Hub pages (e.g. /teams/arsenal), the right rail currently uses a 3-letter team shortcode (e.g. “Follow ARS” and “ARS Newsletter”). This feels too app/database-like.

Goal:
Replace all instances of team shortcodes in UI copy with friendly team names and use club newsletter branding (e.g. “Gunners Mad”, “Spurs Mad”) in the newsletter module.

Requirements:

1) Follow Card Copy (Right Rail)
- Replace “Follow {SHORTCODE}” with “Follow {Team Name}”
  Example: “Follow ARS” -> “Follow Arsenal”
- If logged out:
  Title: “Follow {Team Name}”
  Body: “Sign in to follow teams and personalise your experience.”
  Button: “Sign in to follow”
- If logged in:
  Title: “Follow {Team Name}”
  Button toggles: “Follow” / “Following”
- Do not show shortcodes anywhere on the Team Hub UI (header, cards, buttons).

2) Newsletter Module (Right Rail)
- Replace “{SHORTCODE} Newsletter” with the club newsletter brand in the format: “{Club Newsletter Name}”
  Example: Arsenal -> “Gunners Mad”
- Module body copy:
  “Get {Team Name} news straight to your inbox.”
- Button: “Subscribe”
- If we do not yet have a mapping for a team, fallback to:
  Title: “{Team Name} Mad”
  Example: “Arsenal Mad”
  (but never use 3-letter shortcode as fallback)

3) Create a Team -> Newsletter Name Map (Prem only)
- Implement a mapping object that converts teamSlug (or teamName) to newsletterName.
- Use known brand-friendly names (examples below).
- Ensure this is used wherever the right rail newsletter title is rendered.

Initial mapping examples (add the full set of 20 PL teams):
- arsenal: “Gunners Mad”
- tottenham: “Spurs Mad”
- chelsea: “Blues Mad”
- liverpool: “Reds Mad”
- manchester-city: “City Mad”
- manchester-united: “Red Devils Mad”
- newcastle: “Magpies Mad”
- aston-villa: “Villa Mad”
- brighton: “Seagulls Mad”
- brentford: “Bees Mad”
- crystal-palace: “Eagles Mad”
- everton: “Toffees Mad”
- fulham: “Fulham Mad” (do NOT use “Cottagers”)
- nottingham-forest: “Forest Mad”
- wolves: “Wolves Mad”
- west-ham: “Hammers Mad”
- bournemouth: “Cherries Mad”
- leicester-city: “Foxes Mad”
- ipswich-town: “Ipswich Mad”
- southampton: “Saints Mad”

4) Acceptance Criteria
- No team shortcode appears anywhere in Team Hub UI.
- Right rail follow card reads “Follow {Team Name}”.
- Right rail newsletter reads “{Newsletter Name}” and matches the mapping.
- Fallback is “{Team Name} Mad” if mapping missing.
- Fulham explicitly uses “Fulham Mad” (not Cottagers).
