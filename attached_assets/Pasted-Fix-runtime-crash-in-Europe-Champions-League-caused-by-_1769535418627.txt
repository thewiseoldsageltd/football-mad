Fix runtime crash in Europe > Champions League caused by null scores.

Error:
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'home')
at client/src/components/tables/europe-progress.tsx around line ~161:
{match.score!.home}

Goal:
- Never use non-null assertions on match.score or match.penalties.
- Only render numeric scores when they exist.
- For upcoming fixtures (no score), show no score (or a dash), but DO NOT crash.

Steps:
1) Open: client/src/components/tables/europe-progress.tsx
2) Find the MatchRow component and the section that currently renders:
   {match.score!.home}
   {match.score!.away}
   and penalties like:
   match.penalties!.home / match.penalties!.away
3) Replace score rendering with safe guards:

Implementation details (do exactly this pattern):
- Create safe local vars at top of MatchRow:
  const homeScore = match.score?.home;
  const awayScore = match.score?.away;
  const homePen = match.penalties?.home;
  const awayPen = match.penalties?.away;

- Define:
  const hasScore = Number.isFinite(homeScore) && Number.isFinite(awayScore);
  const hasPenalties = Number.isFinite(homePen) && Number.isFinite(awayPen);

- Wherever the UI currently renders the score, change it to:
  {hasScore ? homeScore : null}
  {hasScore ? awayScore : null}

- Wherever penalties are rendered, change it to:
  {hasPenalties ? ` (${homePen})` : null}
  {hasPenalties ? ` (${awayPen})` : null}

- Ensure "displayScore" logic (if present) uses `hasScore` instead of checking status alone.
  Example:
    const displayScore = hasScore || match.status === "Full-Time" || match.status === "AET" || match.status === "Penalties";
  becomes:
    const displayScore = hasScore;

  (Optional, but preferred) If you still want to show a placeholder for finished matches with missing score, use:
    const displayScore = hasScore;
    const scoreFallback = "–";
    and render fallback only when status indicates finished:
    const isFinished = ["Full-Time","AET","Penalties"].includes(match.status ?? "");
    show scoreFallback when isFinished && !hasScore.

4) Save, let Vite reload, confirm:
- Europe > Champions League loads without crashing
- Upcoming fixtures show date/time and team names even if score is missing
- Finished fixtures still show scores (and penalties in brackets when present)

Do not add/enable regression video testing.
Keep changes minimal to europe-progress.tsx only.
