TASK: News page navigation + filter UX alignment (mobile + desktop consistency)

CONTEXT:
We are standardising navigation patterns across the site using the Injuries page as reference. The News page needs specific improvements:
- Mobile sub-nav should be full-width, scrollable, and NOT abbreviated
- The sub-nav fade mask should not show a left fade at initial state (scrollLeft = 0)
- News filtering should match PA Media tagging navigation: Competition (sub-nav) → Team + Player (filter drawer)
- Remove/hide filters that are not implemented yet (Content Types, Time Range, Sort By)
- Fix mobile filter drawer UX: remove nested scrolling (no scroll-within-scroll)

SCOPE:
- News section only (list page + article page for pills behaviour)
- Reuse existing shared SubNav patterns and styling (grey background, lozenge active tab)
- Keep desktop layout consistent with new nav system

CHANGES — MOBILE NEWS SUB-NAV:
1) Replace abbreviated labels (PL / Champ / L1 / L2) with full labels:
   - Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two (etc.)
2) Ensure sub-nav spans full width on mobile and is horizontally scrollable (same as Injuries)
3) Fade mask behaviour:
   - When sub-nav scrollLeft === 0, DO NOT render left fade
   - Render right fade if content overflows and not at end
   - If user scrolls right (scrollLeft > 0), enable left fade
   - Hide right fade when scrolled to end
   (Do not change styling; only adjust conditional rendering)

CHANGES — NEWS FILTER DRAWER (MOBILE-FIRST):
1) Hide/remove the following filter sections for now (not shown in UI):
   - Content Types
   - Time Range
   - Sort By
2) Keep Team filtering as the primary filter section.
3) Add Player filtering as a search input inside the drawer:
   - label: “Player”
   - placeholder: “Search players…”
   - Typeahead behaviour can be mock/simple for now (filter list client-side from mock player list)
4) Drawer scrolling:
   - Ensure the drawer uses ONE single vertical scroll container
   - Remove nested scroll areas inside the drawer
   - Header stays visible (title + close)
   - Footer stays visible (Apply / Clear)
5) Drawer footer: add a “Competition” selector (dropdown) to let users switch competitions and update team list.
   - This selector should mirror sub-nav competitions.
   - Switching competition should update the Team list options in the drawer.

CHANGES — TAG PILLS (NEWS CARD + ARTICLE):
1) Article card pills:
   - Show maximum 3 pills per card
   - Prioritise pills in this order: Competition → Team → Player
   - Reuse existing pill component styling (no redesign)
2) Article page pills:
   - Show ALL matched pills near the article header (wrap to new lines)
   - Keep the same ordering priority (Competition → Team → Player → others)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not introduce filters that do not work
- Do not change global nav styling; align behaviour only
- Keep everything null-safe
- Maintain existing Ghost/PA Media tagging integration assumptions (tags already exist)

ACCEPTANCE:
- Mobile News sub-nav matches Injuries pattern and uses full names
- Left fade is not visible at initial state; right fade indicates scroll
- Filter drawer has single scrolling area and only shows Team + Player filters
- Drawer includes competition switcher that changes team list
- Cards show max 3 pills; article view shows all pills

Implement now.
