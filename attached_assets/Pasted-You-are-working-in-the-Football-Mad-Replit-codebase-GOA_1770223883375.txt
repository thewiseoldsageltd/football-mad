You are working in the Football Mad Replit codebase.

GOAL
Update the Article page layout so the social share buttons sit inline with the meta row (Substack-style), and remove the redundant desktop sidebar Share card. Also ensure the excerpt is NOT clipped (no line-clamp) on the article page, and move “In this article” above Related Articles. Mobile should keep the sticky bottom Share bar as the primary share mechanism.

FILES LIKELY TO TOUCH
- client/src/pages/article.tsx
- (new) client/src/components/article-meta-bar.tsx (or place inline if you prefer)
- any existing share utils (search for “Share” section, “navigator.share”, “copy link”, “bookmark”)
- any existing bookmark state (if none, implement localStorage MVP)

REQUIREMENTS (DESKTOP)
1) Header order becomes:
   - Pills row (competition + up to 2 teams) [existing EntityPill logic]
   - Title
   - Meta + Actions row (single line)
     LEFT: Author avatar + author name + time + read time + views
     RIGHT: WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Copy Link, Bookmark icons/buttons
   - Hero image
   - Excerpt (full, styled)
   - Article body
   - In this article (grouped)
   - Related articles

2) Remove/disable the RIGHT SIDEBAR “Share” card on desktop (since actions now live in meta row).
   - Keep “Stay in the loop” and “More like this” as desired, but Share card should not render on desktop.
   - If easiest: delete the Share card entirely and keep only sticky share on mobile.

3) Excerpt must not be cut off on article page:
   - Remove any line-clamp classes or max-height applied to excerpt on article.tsx.
   - Cards can keep line-clamp, but article page excerpt must render in full.

4) Move “In this article” above Related Articles.
   - Also fix the grouping: show separate sections with headings:
     “Competitions”, “Teams”, “Players”, “Managers”
   - Each section renders its own EntityPills.
   - Don’t label everything under “Players”.

REQUIREMENTS (MOBILE)
5) Keep the sticky bottom Share bar (existing green bar) as primary share.
   - The new Meta+Actions row may show actions too, but it must not conflict with sticky bar.
   - On mobile, allow the meta row to wrap: actions can sit on a new line under meta if needed.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Create a reusable component ArticleMetaBar:
   - Props:
     authorName, authorInitial?, publishedLabel (e.g. “about 3 hours ago”), readTimeLabel, viewCount,
     shareUrl (canonical article URL),
     initialBookmarked? (optional)
   - Layout:
     wrapper: flex flex-col gap-3 sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between
     left: avatar + author + meta text (small muted)
     right: icon buttons group

B) Actions (Right side):
   - WhatsApp share: open URL like https://wa.me/?text=${encodeURIComponent(title + " " + url)}
   - X share: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${encodeURIComponent(title)}&url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}
   - Facebook share: https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=${encodeURIComponent(url)}
   - Copy: navigator.clipboard.writeText(url) + toast/snackbar (“Link copied”)
   - Bookmark: toggle state; for MVP store in localStorage keyed by article id or slug
     localStorage key suggestion: footballmad:bookmarks (JSON array of ids/slugs)
     Icon changes (outline vs filled) and toast (“Saved” / “Removed”)

C) Styling
   - Icon buttons: 36–40px rounded-full, hover:bg-muted, focus ring
   - Keep minimal and consistent with existing design system

D) Hook up in article.tsx
   - After Title, render <ArticleMetaBar ... />
   - Remove old Share card from sidebar (desktop)
   - Ensure excerpt block uses full text (no clamp) and optionally italic / tinted:
     class suggestion: text-muted-foreground italic leading-relaxed
   - Ensure “In this article” sections appear BEFORE Related Articles

E) Don’t trigger end-to-end regression runs or video recording; focus only on implementation and light local sanity checks.
   - Validate by running the app and visually confirming:
     - Desktop: actions inline with meta row, sidebar share card gone
     - Mobile: sticky share still works and doesn’t overlap content badly
     - Excerpt shows full text
     - In this article grouped correctly and positioned above related
