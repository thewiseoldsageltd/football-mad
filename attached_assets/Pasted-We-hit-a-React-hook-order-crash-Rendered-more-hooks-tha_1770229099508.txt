We hit a React hook-order crash: “Rendered more hooks than during the previous render” at client/src/pages/article.tsx around line ~610 where useMemo is called.

CAUSE
A hook (useMemo and/or new useQuery hooks) is being called conditionally or after an early return. On one render path the component returns before reaching that hook; on another render it reaches it, changing hook count/order.

GOAL
Fix hook order by ensuring ALL hooks (useQuery/useMemo/useEffect/etc) are invoked unconditionally at the top of the ArticlePage component before any returns.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep changes minimal.
- Do NOT run end-to-end/regression tests.
- No video generation.
- Verify via quick refresh only.

DO THIS

1) Open client/src/pages/article.tsx and find the ArticlePage component.
2) Identify any early returns like:
   - if (isLoading) return ...
   - if (error) return ...
   - if (!article) return ...
3) Ensure every hook call is ABOVE those returns, including:
   - the useMemo that builds pills
   - any new useQuery calls for /api/players or /api/managers
   - any useEffect added for fallback logic

4) If we currently call useQuery conditionally (e.g. only when backend entities empty), refactor to call it ALWAYS but gate network with enabled:
   - const playersQuery = useQuery({ queryKey: ["players"], queryFn: fetchPlayers, enabled: !!article });
   - const managersQuery = useQuery({ queryKey: ["managers"], queryFn: fetchManagers, enabled: !!article });

5) Move the pills useMemo so it is ALWAYS executed:
   Example pattern:

   const article = articleQuery.data?.article;

   const players = playersQuery.data ?? [];
   const managers = managersQuery.data ?? [];

   const { articleTeams, competitionPills, playerPills, managerPills } = useMemo(() => {
     const tags = article?.tags ?? [];
     // build pills safely even if article is undefined
     return { articleTeams: [], competitionPills: [], playerPills: [], managerPills: [] };
   }, [article, players, managers]);

6) After hooks are defined, keep the render guards (loading/error/not found) as-is BELOW the hooks.

7) Make sure no hook is inside a block like:
   - if (article) { useMemo(...) }
   - if (fallback) { useQuery(...) }
   - return (...) before a hook later

RESULT
The overlay should disappear, and the article page should render again.

Finally, quickly refresh the Jurrien Timber article page and confirm it loads without the hook-order error.
