Implement Homepage v1 for Football Mad as a modular football dashboard that routes users into News, Teams, and key platform areas.

Goals:

Make the homepage immediately understandable in <5 seconds

Encourage repeat visits (habit-forming)

Reuse existing systems (News, Teams, Follow logic)

Avoid redesigning components already in use

1) Page Structure (Top → Bottom)

Render the homepage using the following modules, in this exact order:

1. Hero Story

Show the latest Editor’s Pick if available, otherwise the most recent article

Use the existing hero/article card style

Clicking opens the article page

2. Today’s Matches Strip

Horizontal strip showing today’s fixtures (use seeded/mock data if needed)

Show: teams + kickoff time

If no matches today, hide the module

3. For You (Personalised)

Only visible if user is logged in AND follows at least one team

Show a mixed feed of latest articles prioritised by followed teams

This is ranking-based, not a hard filter (include major stories too)

4. Trending Now

Pull from News using the existing “Trending” sort logic

Show 6–8 articles

Link to /news?sort=trending

5. Latest News

Standard latest articles feed

Link to /news

6. Teams You Follow / Pick Your Teams

If logged in + follows exist: show followed teams with quick links

If not logged in or no follows: show a CTA to pick teams

7. Newsletter CTA

Simple call to action explaining Football Mad newsletters

Button links to /subscribe (placeholder is fine for now)

8. Shop Teaser

Show 3 featured products or placeholders

CTA: “Visit Shop”

2) Behaviour Rules

Homepage must reuse existing components (article cards, team cards)

No duplicate data logic; all content should come from existing APIs

Modules should fail gracefully (hide if no data)

Homepage should feel fast and scannable on mobile

3) Personalisation Logic (For You)

Rank articles higher if they match followed teams

Do not fully exclude non-followed teams

Clearly label the module as “For You”

4) SEO

Set canonical URL to /

Page title: “Football Mad – News, Teams, Transfers & Fan Insight”

Acceptance Criteria:

Logged-out users see Hero, Trending, Latest, and CTAs

Logged-in users who follow teams see a personalised “For You” section

All links route correctly to existing News and Team pages

No visual clutter or duplicated components
