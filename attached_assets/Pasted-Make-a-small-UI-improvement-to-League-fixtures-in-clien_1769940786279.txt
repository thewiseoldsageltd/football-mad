Make a small UI improvement to League fixtures in client/src/pages/tables.tsx (League fixtures list / LeagueMatchRow).

GOAL
Scheduled matches currently show only kickoff time inline between team names (e.g. "14:00"). This becomes ambiguous when a matchweek spans multiple dates.
Fix: If the selected matchweek has scheduled fixtures across >1 unique date, then scheduled rows should show DATE + TIME in the middle (e.g. "Sun 1 Feb · 14:00"). Otherwise keep showing time only.

RULES
1) Determine if selectedRound’s fixtures span multiple dates:
   - Use the matches already being rendered for the selectedRound (displayMatches / leagueMatchesByRound[selectedRound]).
   - Extract a “kickoff date key” per match from match.kickoffDate (expected "YYYY-MM-DD").
   - Only consider matches that are scheduled (i.e. NOT live/HT/FT).
   - multiDay = number of unique kickoffDate keys > 1.

2) Rendering for scheduled matches:
   - If multiDay === true:
       show formattedDate + " · " + kickoffTime
       formattedDate format: "Sun 1 Feb" (weekday short + day + month short).
   - If multiDay === false:
       show kickoffTime only (existing behaviour).
   - If kickoffDate missing, fall back gracefully:
       - show kickoffTime, or "TBC" if no time.

3)) Leave completed/live/HT/FT rows unchanged:
   - Status pill above row stays as is.
   - Score inline stays as is.

4) Keep styling subtle:
   - The date/time string should use the same “muted” styling as the time currently does (don’t make it louder than the scoreline).
   - Use a middle dot separator (·) with spaces.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Add a small helper to format date:
  - Input: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Output: "Sun 1 Feb"
  - Use Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-GB', { weekday:'short', day:'numeric', month:'short' }) for consistency.
- Compute multiDay once with useMemo based on displayMatches + selectedRound.

DELIVERABLE
- Commit only the changes required.
- Do NOT run tests or long scripts. I will verify manually.
- Output a short summary of what changed and where.
