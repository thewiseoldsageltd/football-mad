We need to fix Matches page data completeness, ordering, and results accuracy.

====================================================
A) COMPETITION PRIORITY (EXPLICIT + DETERMINISTIC)
====================================================

Implement strict, explicit competition ordering in `/api/matches/day`.

1) Define an explicit priority map (lowest number = highest priority):

Tier 0 (must always be top):
- UEFA Champions League
- UEFA Europa League
- UEFA Europa Conference League
- Premier League (England)
- Championship (England)
- League One (England)
- League Two (England)
- National League (England)
- FA Cup (England)
- EFL Cup (England) / Carabao Cup (England)

Tier 1 (Big 5):
- La Liga (Spain)
- Serie A (Italy)
- Bundesliga (Germany)
- Ligue 1 (France)
- Eredivisie (Netherlands)

Tier 2:
- Scottish Premiership
- Scottish Championship
- Scottish Cup

All other competitions:
- Alphabetical order AFTER the above tiers

2) Add a hard demotion rule for youth / reserve competitions.

Create a helper:
isYouthOrReserveCompetition(name: string)

Return true if competition name contains ANY of:
- U21
- U23
- U19
- U18
- Youth
- Reserve
- Reserves
- Premier League 2
- Premier League Cup

If true:
- Force priorityRank = 9000 (or similar)
- These must NEVER outrank senior Tier 0 / Tier 1 leagues

This fixes Premier League 2 / U21 pollution.

====================================================
B) EURO NIGHTS OVERRIDE (UEFA LOGIC)
====================================================

If the selected date contains ANY UEFA matches:
- UEFA Champions League
- UEFA Europa League
- UEFA Europa Conference League

Then:
- UEFA competitions must float ABOVE all domestic leagues
- Internal UEFA order remains:
  UCL → UEL → UECL

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT treat CAF / AFC / CONCACAF Champions League as UEFA
- Match must explicitly start with "UEFA"

Example:
- Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday with UEL → UEL above Premier League
- Saturday with UCL night → UCL above Premier League
- No UEFA matches → default domestic priority applies

====================================================
C) SORTING MODES (BACKEND + FRONTEND)
====================================================

Support query param: `sort=competition|kickoff`

Default: sort=competition

Sorting rules:

sort=competition:
1) priorityRank
2) competitionName (alphabetical)
3) kickoffTime

sort=kickoff:
1) kickoffTime
2) priorityRank
3) competitionName

Frontend:
- Restore Sort dropdown
- Options:
  - Competition (default)
  - Kick-off time
- Send `sort` param to `/api/matches/day`

====================================================
D) FIX MISSING FINAL SCORES (RESULTS BUG)
====================================================

Issue:
Finished games are showing "-" instead of scores.

Fix in Goalserve ingest:

1) When status is FT / finished:
- Parse final scores from correct Goalserve fields
- Persist homeScore and awayScore

2) Never overwrite non-null final scores with null
- If a later ingest has no score fields, skip score update

3) Add minimal logging:
- Count FT matches ingested with scores
- Count FT matches missing scores

This fixes Thursday results showing no scores.

====================================================
E) FIX MISSING FUTURE FIXTURES (SATURDAY BUG)
====================================================

Root cause:
Only ingesting `soccernew/home` → does NOT contain full future schedules.

Required feeds to ingest:

1) Continue:
- soccernew/home (today snapshot)
- soccernew/live (live updates)

2) ADD scheduled ingests:
- soccernew/d-1   → yesterday results
- soccernew/d1    → tomorrow fixtures
- soccernew/d2..d7 → next 7 days fixtures

Recommended cadence:
- home + live: every 5–10 minutes
- d1..d7: hourly
- d-1: hourly or daily

This ensures:
- Saturday shows FULL fixture list (Premier League first)
- Tomorrow is not limited to 5 obscure matches

(Optional hardening)
For Tier 0 / Tier 1 leagues:
- Periodically ingest `soccerfixtures/leagueid/{leagueId}`
- Guarantees long-range schedules beyond 7 days

====================================================
F) ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
====================================================

✅ Today:
- No Premier League 2 / U21 at the top
- Senior competitions only in Tier order

✅ Thursday (results):
- UEFA Europa League first
- Final scores visible (not "-")

✅ Saturday (fixtures):
- Full schedule visible
- Premier League first, then Championship, etc.

✅ UI:
- Sort dropdown present
- sort=competition and sort=kickoff both work

====================================================
