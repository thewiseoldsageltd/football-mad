TEAM HUB v2.2 — TRANSFERS TAB (FULL SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION)

Context
- We have Team Hub v2 working with tabs: Latest, Injuries, Transfers, Matches, Fans.
- Injuries tab v2.1 now has a strong layout with left content + right sidebar cards.
- Transfers tab currently shows a “No transfer activity” empty state.
- We are NOT implementing ingestion yet; we will implement UI + local mocked data + clear types/interfaces.

Goal
- Build a premium “Transfers” tab experience that:
  1) Works great with mocked data now
  2) Is ready to connect to a feed later
  3) Feels consistent with Football Mad design system (pills, cards, spacing, subtle shadows, green accents)

Routes
- Transfers tab URL: /teams/:teamSlug/transfers
- Ensure clicking Transfers updates URL + active tab highlight.
- Ensure navigating back to Latest returns to /teams/:teamSlug (no /latest).
- Ensure scroll-to-top behavior on navigation is correct (already fixed for articles; ensure Team Hub respects it too).

Layout (Desktop)
- Keep the same overall layout as Injuries:
  - Left: main transfers content (approx 8/12 columns)
  - Right: sidebar stack (Follow card, Newsletter card, More from Team)
- Maintain the same spacing, card radius, borders, shadows used in Injuries.

Transfers Tab: Sections (Left Column)
1) Header block (top of left content)
- Title: “Transfers”
- Subtitle: “Latest rumours and deals for {Team Name}”
- If there is data: show a small “Window” pill (e.g. “January Window”) and a “Last updated” line.
- If no data: show “No transfer activity right now” but still keep the tab page looking premium.

2) Transfer Summary Bar (optional but recommended)
- A compact horizontal bar with three stats:
  - In: X
  - Out: Y
  - Net: £Z (or “Net: —” if unknown)
- Use pills/badges or mini-cards inside one container.
- This bar should render if any transfer items exist OR if mocked summary exists.

3) Confirmed Deals (primary section)
- Heading: “Confirmed Deals”
- Two sub-tabs OR two rows (simple is fine):
  - “In” list
  - “Out” list
- Each deal is a card with:
  - Player name
  - Position (optional)
  - From/To club
  - Fee (e.g. “£45m”, “Loan”, “Free”, “Undisclosed”)
  - Date
  - Status pill: “Confirmed”
  - Source text (for now: “Source: Club / Reliable”)
- Use consistent card styling with injuries cards.

4) Rumours & Links (secondary section)
- Heading: “Rumours & Links”
- A list/grid of rumour cards with:
  - Player name
  - Linked club (the other club)
  - Direction pill: “Linked In” / “Linked Out”
  - Confidence meter (0–100) similar to injuries (simple bar)
  - “Stage” pill: “Interest”, “Talks”, “Bid”, “Medical” (optional)
  - Source label (e.g. “Tier 1”, “Tier 2”, “Tabloid” as placeholder)
- Each rumour card should be slightly lighter than confirmed cards.

5) Empty States (VERY IMPORTANT)
If there are NO confirmed deals and NO rumours:
- Show a premium empty state card (not a thin grey box):
  - Icon
  - Title: “No transfer activity”
  - Text: “No confirmed deals or strong rumours for {Team Name} right now.”
  - Optional CTA button: “See all transfer news” -> /transfers (global nav Transfers)
- Keep spacing so page doesn’t look empty.

Sidebar (Right Column)
- Reuse the existing sidebar cards from Team Hub v2:
  1) Follow {Team Name} card (auth gated)
  2) {Newsletter Name} card (club-specific e.g. “Gunners Mad” not “ARS Newsletter”)
  3) More from {Team Name} (list of 3–5 articles)
- Ensure newsletter name is derived from team nickname mapping (simple mapping object for now).
  - Example:
    - arsenal -> Gunners Mad
    - chelsea -> Blues Mad
    - liverpool -> Reds Mad
    - manchester-united -> Red Devils Mad
  - If missing mapping, fallback: “{Team Name} Mad”

Data Model (Mock now; ready for later)
- Add a local mock object for transfers keyed by teamSlug:
  - confirmedIn: []
  - confirmedOut: []
  - rumours: []
  - summary: { inCount, outCount, netSpendText, lastUpdated, windowLabel }
- Create TypeScript types/interfaces for:
  - TransferDeal
  - TransferRumour
  - TransferSummary

Component Structure (suggested)
- client/src/pages/TeamHub/TeamTransfers.tsx (or wherever other tab components live)
- TeamHub shell decides active tab from URL path (already done).
- TeamTransfers renders:
  - TransfersHeader
  - TransfersSummaryBar
  - ConfirmedDealsSection
  - RumoursSection
  - EmptyState (when needed)

UX & Styling
- Buttons should have subtle lift on hover (shadow + translateY -1px).
- Pills consistent with article pills:
  - Confirmed = green or dark
  - Rumour = grey/amber
  - Linked In/Out = blue/red (subtle)
- Keep typography:
  - Section headings bold
  - Body text readable like Substack (good line-height)

Acceptance Criteria
- /teams/arsenal/transfers shows:
  - Transfers title/subtitle
  - Confirmed Deals section (can be empty)
  - Rumours section (can be empty)
  - Premium empty state if both empty
  - Sidebar shows Follow + Newsletter (“Gunners Mad”) + More from Arsenal
- URL updates correctly and Transfers tab highlight is correct.
- Latest tab always returns to /teams/arsenal and highlights correctly.
- No console errors.

Implementation Notes
- Do not build ingestion yet.
- Keep mocks simple but realistic (2 rumours minimum for Arsenal, 0 confirmed by default).
- Make sure content area width doesn’t look sparse; align to existing grid.

Please implement this Transfers tab now.
