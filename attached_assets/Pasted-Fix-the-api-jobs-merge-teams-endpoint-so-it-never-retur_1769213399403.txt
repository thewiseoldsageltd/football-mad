Fix the /api/jobs/merge-teams endpoint so it never returns "current transaction is aborted..." and correctly handles the teams_goalserve_team_id_unique constraint.

Context:
Calling merge-teams currently returns 500 with:
"current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block"
Previously it also threw:
"duplicate key value violates unique constraint teams_goalserve_team_id_unique"

Requirements:
1) Refactor merge-teams to use Drizzle's db.transaction(async (tx) => { ... }) ONLY.
   - No manual BEGIN/COMMIT.
   - No catching errors inside the transaction and continuing.
   - If anything fails, throw so Drizzle rolls back.

2) Preflight (BEFORE starting tx):
   - Load keepTeam and removeTeam from teams by id.
   - Determine desiredGoalserveTeamId:
       - If keepTeam.goalserveTeamId is null and removeTeam.goalserveTeamId exists -> we want to move it to keep
       - Otherwise keep keepTeam.goalserveTeamId
   - If desiredGoalserveTeamId exists, check if ANY other team (id not in [keep, remove]) already has that goalserveTeamId.
     - If yes, return 409 with a helpful message listing that conflicting team id+name+slug+goalserveTeamId.

3) In the transaction, do updates in this safe order:
   a) If moving goalserveTeamId from remove -> keep:
      - First set removeTeam.goalserveTeamId = null
      - Then set keepTeam.goalserveTeamId = desiredGoalserveTeamId
   b) Update matches.homeTeamId and matches.awayTeamId from removeTeamId -> keepTeamId
   c) Optionally normalize keep team display name/slug/league if needed (keep as-is for now unless already implemented)
   d) If deleteRemoved === true: delete the remove team row after match updates

4) Error handling:
   - Outside tx, catch once.
   - Map conflict/preflight failures to 409.
   - Otherwise return 500 with a clean error message.
   - Never leak "current transaction is aborted..." again.

5) Keep auth middleware the same: requireJobSecret("GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET")
6) Keep route path and request body shape unchanged.

After changes:
- Restart dev server.
- Re-run the exact curl merge request.
