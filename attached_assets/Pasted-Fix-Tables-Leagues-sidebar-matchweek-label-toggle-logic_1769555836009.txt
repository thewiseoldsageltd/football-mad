Fix Tables > Leagues sidebar matchweek label + toggle logic.

IMPORTANT:
DO NOT run tests, scripts, browsers, or automated verification.
DO NOT add testing code.
ONLY modify application source code related to matchweek navigation and display.
I will test manually.

Bug:
Sidebar header shows “Matchweek 1” but the fixtures shown are clearly from a later week (e.g. MW23).
This means the UI label is using array index instead of the real matchweek key, and/or matchesByRound keys are being grouped incorrectly so only one round appears.

Scope:
Find the component that renders the right-hand “Fixtures” sidebar on the Tables page for domestic leagues (Premier League etc). It contains:
- Prev/Next chevrons
- “Matchweek X” title
- Date range
- Fixtures list

Fix requirements:

1) Build rounds from REAL DATA KEYS
- Use: const roundKeys = Object.keys(matchesByRound ?? {})
- Treat matchweek keys like "MW23"
- Extract number: const n = parseInt(String(key).match(/(\d+)/)?.[1] ?? "", 10)
- Ignore invalid numbers
- Sort ascending by n
- Create:
  normalizedKey = `MW${n}`
  originalKey = key
- Build map: normalizedKey -> originalKey

2) Selected round state must store NORMALIZED KEY (e.g. "MW23")
- When fetching matches, resolve originalKey from the map
- NEVER use array index as the matchweek id

3) Matchweek label must come from the key, NOT index
- Display: Matchweek ${number extracted from selectedRound}
- Never show “Matchweek 0”
- Never use index+1

4) Default selection must be the latest real matchweek
- On load or when data changes:
  - Find highest week number that has matches
  - Fallback: highest week number
- If URL param exists (?mw=MWxx), validate it first

5) Prev/Next navigation must move through the sorted normalized keys
- Find current index using normalized key
- Prev = index - 1
- Next = index + 1
- Disable correctly at boundaries

6) Keep layout and styling exactly the same
Only fix data handling, key normalization, label logic, and toggle behaviour.

Optional debug logs are allowed ONLY if wrapped in a condition like:
if (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("debug") === "1")

Deliverable:
Working matchweek toggle using real matchweek numbers (e.g. MW23 shows “Matchweek 23”), correct default to latest week, and proper prev/next behaviour.
