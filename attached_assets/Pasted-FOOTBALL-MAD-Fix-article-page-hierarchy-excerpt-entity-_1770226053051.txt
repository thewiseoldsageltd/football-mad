FOOTBALL MAD — Fix article page hierarchy, excerpt, entity grouping, and mobile share UX (NO E2E / NO video regression runs).

Context:
- Article page is /news/:slug (React + Tailwind)
- Entity pills exist (EntityPill component)
- Current problems:
  1) Excerpt is being cut off/truncated — must show full excerpt
  2) “In this article” grouping is wrong: Teams + Managers appear under Players
  3) Mobile UX: share icons appear in meta row AND there is a “Share this article” block AND sticky share bar (overkill)
  4) Mobile: “In this article” appears below newsletter/signup/share blocks — it must appear immediately after article body
  5) Cards only show competition pill — should show competition + up to 2 teams when available

Hard requirements:
- Do NOT add any hardcoded KNOWN_MANAGERS lists.
- Do NOT rely on Ghost tags for entity typing. Use our extracted entities / Goalserve-backed entity types.
- Do NOT run end-to-end/regression testing tools (Playwright/Cypress) or generate videos.
- Keep changes minimal and well-structured.

Tasks:

A) Make entity typing first-class (backend)
1) Update the server-side article/entity extraction so every pill entity includes a reliable type:
   - competition | team | player | manager
2) Ensure article payload includes these grouped arrays (or a single entities[] array with type field):
   - competition?: EntityData
   - teams: EntityData[]
   - players: EntityData[]
   - managers: EntityData[]
3) The typing source of truth:
   - If we already have an entities table with type/role, use that.
   - If we store people with a role (player/manager), use that role.
   - If we only have Goalserve IDs, infer via Goalserve entity category mapping (player vs coach/manager).
4) Ensure the News list API and Article API both return enough data for pills:
   - competition + up to 2 teams for cards
   - full grouped entities for article page

B) Fix excerpt truncation (frontend)
1) Find the excerpt rendering in client/src/pages/article.tsx.
2) Remove any tailwind classes like line-clamp-*, truncate, max-h, overflow-hidden that cause cut-off.
3) Render the excerpt as full text.
4) Add a rule: only show excerpt if it exists AND it is not effectively the same as the first paragraph of the body (simple heuristic is fine: compare normalized first ~140 chars). If duplicate, hide excerpt.

C) Correct article page layout and dividers
Desktop order:
- Pills row (competition + teamA + teamB)
- Title
- Divider
- Meta row with inline share icons + bookmark (Substack-style) (keep as-is on desktop)
- Hero
- Excerpt (if shown) styled muted + italic
- Divider (only if excerpt shown)
- Body
- Divider
- “In this article” grouped: Competitions, Teams, Players, Managers (only show group if it has items)
- Related articles

Mobile rules:
1) Hide the inline share icons/bookmark in the meta row on small screens (keep only author/time/read/views).
2) Remove the bottom “Share this article” block entirely on mobile (or remove it globally if redundant).
3) Keep the sticky bottom share bar as the ONLY share CTA on mobile.
4) Ensure “In this article” section appears immediately after the article body on mobile (before any newsletter/signup blocks).
   - If newsletter/signup is in right rail on desktop, keep it there; but on mobile it stacks, so position “In this article” before that stack.

D) Fix “cards only show competition pill”
1) In article-card.tsx (or wherever pills are computed), render:
   - competition pill always if present
   - plus up to 2 team pills if present (home/away or first two teams)
2) Use EntityPill with iconUrl when available.

E) Add small debug aids (optional)
- Add console.debug only behind a simple DEV guard (import.meta.env.DEV) if you need it. Remove noisy logs.

Deliverables:
- Implement changes with clean types in shared/schema.ts
- No hacks, no hardcoded manager lists
- Verify manually by loading:
  - /news page cards show competition + teams
  - An article shows correct grouping (Teams separate, Managers separate)
  - Excerpt not truncated
  - Mobile shows no inline share icons; sticky share remains; “In this article” is above newsletter/signup
