You are updating the existing Football Mad web app.

TASK: Refine the Tables tab structure and behaviour to align with agreed UX and navigation standards across the site.

GOALS:
- Remove redundant options
- Improve desktop vs mobile data density
- Lock consistency with other tabs (Matches, Teams, Transfers)

IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING:

1) TABLES TAB — PRIMARY STRUCTURE
- Keep main nav item: “Tables”
- Page title: “Tables”
- Subtitle: “League standings and tournament progress”
- Icon: Trophy (consistent with current design)

2) SUB-NAVIGATION (TOP LEVEL)
- Tabs (left-aligned on desktop, scrollable on mobile):
  - Leagues (default)
  - Cups
  - Europe
- Behaviour mirrors Matches / Transfers sub-nav rules exactly

3) LEAGUES VIEW (DEFAULT STATE)
- REMOVE “All” competition option entirely
- Default competition on first load:
  - Premier League
- Competition selector includes:
  - Premier League
  - Championship
  - League One
  - League Two
  - La Liga
  - Serie A
  - Bundesliga
  - Ligue 1

4) FILTERS (RIGHT-ALIGNED DESKTOP / CENTRED MOBILE)
- Season dropdown (default: current season, e.g. 2025/26)
- View dropdown:
  - Overall (default)
  - Home
  - Away
- No additional filters for now

5) TABLE — DESKTOP PRESENTATION
Show a rich table with the following columns:
- Pos
- Team (with crest/avatar)
- P (Played)
- W
- D
- L
- GF
- GA
- GD (colour-coded: green for +, red for -)
- Pts (bold)

- Highlight:
  - Top positions (e.g. title / Europe) with subtle left border
  - Relegation zone with subtle red indicator

6) TABLE — MOBILE PRESENTATION
Show a simplified table:
- Pos
- Team
- Pts (bold)

Secondary row or muted columns:
- P
- GD

RULES:
- Do NOT show full stats by default on mobile
- Keep layout scannable and vertical
- No “expand all” or advanced toggles yet

7) CONSISTENCY RULES
- Typography, spacing, pills, dropdowns must reuse existing shared components
- Alignment rules:
  - Desktop filters right-aligned
  - Mobile filters centre-aligned
- No “All” option anywhere in Tables unless stacking multiple tables vertically (not implemented now)

8) DATA
- Use existing dummy data placeholders
- Structure components so Goalserve data can be injected later without refactor

OUTPUT:
- Update the Tables page UI only
- Do NOT modify other tabs
- Ensure no regressions to navigation, spacing, or alignment
