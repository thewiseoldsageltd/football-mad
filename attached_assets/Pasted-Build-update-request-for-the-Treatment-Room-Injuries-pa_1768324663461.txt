Build update request for the Treatment Room (Injuries) page UI.

Goal

Refine navigation + filters hierarchy for mobile, while keeping desktop layout exactly as it currently looks.

1) Mobile sub-navigation: make it one-line + horizontally scrollable

On mobile breakpoints (<= 768px):

The sub-navigation tabs (Overview, Returning, Coin flip, Doubtful, Out) should be one single row, not wrapped onto 2 lines.

The tab row should be horizontally scrollable with touch swipe.

Tabs should have white-space: nowrap.

Keep the same styling (pill/tabs) but ensure the container uses something like:

display: flex

overflow-x: auto

-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch

scrollbar-width: none and hide scrollbar visually

Add a subtle left/right fade gradient (optional but preferred) to hint that the tab row scrolls.

Keep the active tab clearly indicated (current styling is fine).

Desktop (>= 769px):

The sub-navigation remains exactly as it is now (single row, fully visible, no scrolling needed).

2) Filters placement: keep current hierarchy, but ensure mobile order is:

On mobile:

Sub-navigation row (scrollable)

“All Teams” dropdown

Sort dropdown (Closest return, etc.)

On desktop:

Keep filters right-aligned on the same horizontal line as the sub-navigation (current state is good).

3) Center the “All Teams” label text inside the dropdown

Currently, “All Teams” label appears left-aligned.

Update the dropdown trigger so:

The label text is centered horizontally in the button area.

The caret icon remains right-aligned.

The left icon (if any) remains left-aligned.

This should work consistently across mobile + desktop.

Implementation hint:

Use a 3-column layout inside the trigger:

left slot (icon or empty)

center slot (label text, centered)

right slot (caret)

Ensure the center text stays centered even when left icon is missing.

4) Don’t break anything else

Do not change data logic, sorting logic, card layout, colours, or typography.

This task is strictly layout + alignment polish.

Acceptance checks

Mobile: tabs are one row and scroll horizontally.

Mobile: dropdowns are full width and sit below the tabs (as now).

Desktop: layout remains unchanged.

“All Teams” label is visually centered in its dropdown trigger.
