You are working in the Football Mad codebase.

Goal: Fix Conference League (and all Europe tables) Matchday navigation.
Current bug: Landing on Matchday 8 is correct, but clicking back from MD8 does nothing; clicking forward from MD8 jumps to MD1. We need numeric ordering and non-wrapping prev/next navigation.

Constraints:
- Do NOT run regression tests.
- Keep existing UI/UX (same buttons, same label "Matchday X").
- Fix should apply to Europe pages (UCL/UEL/UECL) where matchday navigation is shown.

What to do:
1) Find the client-side component that renders the Europe "Fixtures" Matchday selector (the one with left/right chevrons and the "Matchday X" label) on the Tables page.
   - Search in /client for "Matchday", "matchday", "fixtures", "ChevronLeft", "ChevronRight", or "No fixtures yet".
2) Ensure matchday keys are handled numerically, not lexicographically, and the array is stable:
   - If matchdays are strings like "MD8" or "matchday_8", parse the number.
   - Create a helper:
     - extractMatchdayNumber(keyOrLabel: string): number
     - sort matchdays by that number ascending.
3) Compute currentIndex safely:
   - const idx = sortedMatchdays.findIndex(md => md.key === selectedKey) (or compare on number)
   - If idx === -1, set idx to last index (so default is latest matchday).
4) Fix navigation:
   - Prev should go to idx-1 ONLY if idx > 0, otherwise do nothing (or keep disabled).
   - Next should go to idx+1 ONLY if idx < sortedMatchdays.length-1, otherwise do nothing (or keep disabled).
   - Remove any modulo/wrap logic that jumps from last -> first or first -> last.
5) Ensure the selected matchday state updates correctly and triggers fixtures re-render.

Acceptance checks (manual, no tests):
- Conference League 2025/26 loads on Matchday 8.
- Clicking left goes MD8 -> MD7 -> MD6 ... -> MD1.
- Clicking right from MD1 goes to MD2 etc.
- Clicking right from MD8 does NOT wrap to MD1.
- The left chevron is disabled on MD1, right chevron disabled on the last matchday.

Implement the change cleanly with a small helper and minimal code churn.
After implementing, tell me:
- The file(s) you edited
- The exact logic used to sort and navigate
