TASK: Update Team Hub > Injuries tab UX to remove redundant pills and use the final tab system.

CONTEXT
We already ingest FPL availability into the DB (fplPlayerAvailability) and render the Injuries tab on /teams/:slug/injuries using that data. We previously added “OUT” / “LOANED” pills and multiple filter tabs. We want to simplify and standardise.

GOAL (FINAL UX)
1) REMOVE the red “OUT:x” and grey “LOANED:x” pills entirely.
2) KEEP ONLY these tabs (in this exact order), with counts:
   - Overview (All)
   - Coin flip (50%)
   - Doubtful (25%)
   - Out (0%)
   - Suspended
   - Loans/Transfers
3) Default tab = Overview.
4) Tabs should filter the list instantly (client-side is fine if we’re already fetching the list; server-side is fine too).
5) Overview view should show ALL players, but grouped into sections (with section headings), in this order:
   - Returning soon (75%)
   - Coin flip (50%)
   - Doubtful (25%)
   - Out (0%)
   - Suspended
   - Loans/Transfers
   Each section should show a count and only render if count > 0.
6) Single-tab views:
   - Coin flip (50%): show only players where chance (use the SAME chance field we decided: prefer next round over this round if present) equals 50
   - Doubtful (25%): show only players where chance equals 25
   - Out (0%): show only players where chance equals 0 AND the item is NOT a loan/transfer AND NOT suspended (those should appear in their own tabs)
   - Suspended: show only players whose status/news indicates suspension (see “classification rules”)
   - Loans/Transfers: show only players whose status/news indicates they are loaned out / transferred away / left the club (see “classification rules”)

CLASSIFICATION RULES (IMPORTANT)
We need deterministic classification so tabs + overview grouping are correct.

A) CHANCE VALUE
- Compute `displayChance` as:
  - if chance_of_playing_next_round is not null: use that
  - else use chance_of_playing_this_round
  - if both are null: treat as 100 (available) UNLESS fplStatus != "a" OR news is non-empty, then treat as 0 (unknown/unavailable)
(Keep this consistent with whatever we already changed in the codebase.)

B) LOANS/TRANSFERS
A player should be classified as Loans/Transfers if:
- news contains phrases like:
  - "has joined" OR "joined" OR "on loan" OR "loan" OR "permanent" OR "transferred" OR "move to" OR "signed for" OR "left the club"
AND/OR
- fplStatus indicates not in squad (if we have a known mapping; if not, rely on news text)
If classified as Loans/Transfers, they should ONLY appear in Loans/Transfers (not Out).

C) SUSPENDED
Classify as Suspended if:
- news contains "suspended" OR "suspension" OR "ban" OR "red card" OR "disciplinary"
If Suspended, they should ONLY appear in Suspended (not Out).

D) OUT (0%)
Out tab should represent genuine injury/availability 0% that is NOT loan/transfer and NOT suspension.
So:
- displayChance === 0
- AND not classified as Loans/Transfers
- AND not classified as Suspended

E) RETURNING SOON (75%)
This is only a section in Overview (not a standalone tab).
- displayChance === 75

F) AVAILABLE (100%)
We generally don’t need a tab for 100%. In Overview, 100% players should NOT be shown (this is injuries & availability, we want only impacted players).
So: only show players where (displayChance is 75/50/25/0) OR classified as Suspended OR Loans/Transfers.
Do not show 100% in this tab view.

UI DETAILS
- Tabs should look like our current pill-style tabs (rounded, compact). The active tab has the green fill.
- Each tab label should include count e.g. “Coin flip (2)”.
- Overview label: “Overview (X)” where X is total of all rendered items across all categories (not including 100% available).
- For card rows, keep current layout (initials avatar circle + name + position pill + one-line news string + updated time).
- Ensure the “Most Recent / Lowest %” controls are removed or replaced:
  - Remove “Lowest %” entirely (we no longer want this sort).
  - Keep “Most Recent” as the only sort toggle if it exists OR just default to Most Recent ordering.
  - Ordering within a section: most recently updated first.

TECHNICAL TODO
- Update the Injuries tab component to implement the classification + grouping + tabs.
- If any server route is returning data sorted/filtered, adjust as needed.
- Add unit-ish helper functions for:
  - getDisplayChance(record)
  - classifyAvailability(record) -> one of: returningSoon | coinFlip | doubtful | out | suspended | loansTransfers | ignore
- Ensure consistency across teams.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
- No more OUT/LOANED pills above tabs.
- Tabs show correct counts.
- Clicking “Out” does NOT show loaned-out or suspended players.
- Overview shows grouped sections in the specified order.
- The Arsenal example includes those “has joined …” players under Loans/Transfers (not Out).
- Hincapié at 75% appears under Returning soon and not green “100%”.

Please implement now.
