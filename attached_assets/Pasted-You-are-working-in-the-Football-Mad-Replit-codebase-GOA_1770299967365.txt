You are working in the Football Mad Replit codebase.

GOAL
Fix 3 UX issues around entity pills:
1) Desktop news cards should show FULL pill labels (e.g. “Carabao Cup”, “Man City”) — NOT shortcodes.
2) Article header pills should remain SHORTCODES on mobile only (e.g. “CC”, “MCI”), but show FULL labels on desktop.
3) “In this article” footer:
   - Remove ALL “Show more” / clamping / collapsible behaviour (always show all pills).
   - Competitions + Teams should display FULL labels even on mobile.
   - Players + Managers can remain full labels (also fine).

CONSTRAINTS
- Do not change the entity selection/scoring logic (tag=100, mention=60, fallback=10 etc). Only change DISPLAY + footer behaviour.
- Keep the existing EntityPill look/shape; only adjust what text it renders.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
A) Add display options to EntityPill
- Update the EntityPill component to accept optional props:
  - `labelMode?: "full" | "short"`
  - `shortLabel?: string | null` (already often available as team.shortName; competitions may have a shortcode field or we can derive a fallback)
- Behaviour:
  - If labelMode === "short" and shortLabel exists => render shortLabel
  - Else render the full label (existing behaviour)
- Default labelMode should be "full" (so desktop naturally shows full unless explicitly set)

B) Create a tiny responsive hook/helper for “isMobile”
- Add `useIsMobile()` hook in `client/src/hooks/use-is-mobile.ts` (or similar) that returns boolean using `matchMedia("(max-width: 640px)")`
- Use it only where we need conditional labelMode (article header pills). Avoid using it everywhere.

C) Fix News card pills (desktop full)
- In `client/src/components/article-card.tsx` (or wherever your news card lives), ensure you DO NOT force labelMode="short".
- If you currently use shortcodes globally, remove that.
- Result: card pills render full labels on desktop; on mobile, it’s okay if they remain short OR full, but per requirement: desktop must be full.

D) Fix Article header pills (mobile shortcodes only)
- In `client/src/pages/article.tsx` where header pills are rendered:
  - Use `const isMobile = useIsMobile();`
  - Pass `labelMode={isMobile ? "short" : "full"}` to Competition + Team pills in the header.
  - Provide `shortLabel`:
    - Teams: use `team.shortName` if present, otherwise derive 3-letter from name.
    - Competitions: use existing shortcode if you have one; otherwise:
      - “Carabao Cup” => “CC”
      - “Premier League” => “EPL”
      - “Champions League” => “UCL”
      - “Europa League” => “UEL”
      - “Conference League” => “UECL”
      - Else derive initials (first letters of words, max 4)
  - IMPORTANT: This mobile-only shortcode behaviour is ONLY for the header pills row.

E) Remove “Show more” / clamping in “In this article”
- Locate the collapsible/clamping component introduced earlier (e.g. `CollapsibleEntityGroup` or any ResizeObserver overflow logic).
- Delete it OR refactor it to a simple `EntityGroup` that:
  - Renders group title + all pills, no measurement, no state, no toggles.
- In the footer:
  - Competitions group pills: force FULL labels always => `labelMode="full"`
  - Teams group pills: force FULL labels always => `labelMode="full"`
  - Players & Managers: render full labels (default) (no shortcodes)

FILES TO TOUCH (expected)
- `client/src/components/entity-pill.tsx` (or wherever EntityPill is)
- `client/src/hooks/use-is-mobile.ts`
- `client/src/components/article-card.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/article.tsx`
- Remove/refactor any footer clamping component (wherever it currently lives)

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
1) Desktop /news:
- Marc Guehi card shows pills: “Carabao Cup” and “Man City” (NOT “CC”, “MCI”).
2) Mobile article header:
- Header pills show shortcodes (e.g. “CC”, “MCI”).
3) Desktop article header:
- Header pills show full labels.
4) Mobile “In this article”:
- Competitions shows “Carabao Cup” (full), Teams shows “Man City” (full), Players/Managers show full names.
- No “Show more” links anywhere.

After changes, run the app and verify with the Marc Guehi article and /news list. No end to end testing, and no videos.
