You are working in the Football Mad codebase.

Decision: Remove ALL Matchday/Matchweek/fixtures panels from the Tables tab. Tables tab should show STANDINGS ONLY across all competitions and seasons.

Constraints:
- Do NOT run regression tests.
- Keep other areas (e.g. Matches page) untouched.
- Tables page layout should remain clean: Standings card should expand to full width (or use existing responsive layout).
- Do not break existing API consumers; but it’s OK to stop requesting/using rounds/matchesByRound/matchdays on the Tables page.

Tasks:

A) CLIENT (UI) — remove Fixtures/Matchday panel from Tables tab
1) Find the Tables page component(s) that render:
   - the right-hand "Fixtures" card
   - the Matchday/Matchweek navigation (chevrons and label)
   - the "No fixtures available / No fixtures yet" state
2) Remove those UI blocks entirely from the Tables tab.
3) Update layout so the standings table takes the full width:
   - If currently a 2-column grid, switch to 1-column when fixtures panel removed.
4) Remove any state/hooks/data-fetching on the Tables page that is only used for fixtures navigation:
   - selectedMatchday / selectedMatchweek
   - rounds/matchdays arrays
   - matchesByRound / fixturesByMatchday mapping
   - effects that set default matchday/week
   Keep standings fetch and standings render intact.

B) CLIENT (API usage) — stop relying on fixtures fields
5) Wherever Tables page fetches /api/standings or /api/europe/:slug:
   - Ensure the UI only reads snapshot + table.
   - Remove references to response.rounds, response.matchesByRound, response.defaultMatchweek, response.latestRoundKey, matchdays, etc.

C) SERVER (optional but recommended) — add “tablesOnly=1” flag to reduce payload
6) In server/routes.ts:
   - /api/standings: if req.query.tablesOnly === "1", skip Goalserve XML fetch and do NOT compute rounds/matchesByRound even for 2025/26 PL.
     Return only { snapshot, table }.
   - /api/europe/:slug: if tablesOnly === "1", return standings-only (skip fixtures/matchday computation).
7) Then in the Tables page fetch calls, add tablesOnly=1 to the requests:
   - /api/standings?...&tablesOnly=1
   - /api/europe/...?...&tablesOnly=1
This keeps the server logic available for later (when we revisit fixtures), but Tables stays standings-only.

Manual checks (no tests):
- Tables page shows ONLY standings for Premier League and Europe comps.
- No Fixtures card is visible.
- No Matchday/Matchweek UI exists.
- No console errors about rounds/matchesByRound/matchdays.
- Page looks good on desktop (standings uses full width).

After changes, output:
- Files changed
- What was removed (UI blocks + any states/hooks)
- Any new query param usage (tablesOnly=1)
