TASK: Replace team crests and player headshots/initial-circles with a consistent “club colour + 3-letter code / initials” badge system across the site.

GOAL:
- Anywhere we currently show a team crest (e.g., Teams page tiles/list rows), replace it with a rounded badge showing the club’s official 3-letter abbreviation (ARS, AVL, etc.) on the club background colour with the club text colour.
- Anywhere we currently show a player avatar circle that contains initials (e.g., Team Hub > Injuries list), ensure the avatar circle uses the player’s team background colour and team text colour for initials.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove or override the existing injury status “ring” colour styling around player circles. The ring must remain exactly as it is today (same colour logic, same thickness). Only change the inner circle fill + initials colour.

DATA: Add a single source of truth mapping for Premier League clubs used on Football Mad:
Use these hex codes (ensure they are prefixed with #):

TEAM_STYLE_MAP = {
  "Arsenal":            { bg: "#D02E26", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "ARS" },
  "Aston Villa":        { bg: "#410724", fg: "#9DBDE2", abbr: "AVL" },
  "Bournemouth":        { bg: "#B7312D", fg: "#A89C74", abbr: "BOU" },
  "Brentford":          { bg: "#B12418", fg: "#0F0F0F", abbr: "BRE" },
  "Brighton":           { bg: "#1C4794", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "BHA" },
  "Burnley":            { bg: "#570C3F", fg: "#7EC6F1", abbr: "BUR" },
  "Chelsea":            { bg: "#031484", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "CHE" },
  "Crystal Palace":     { bg: "#2354A0", fg: "#D63827", abbr: "CRY" },
  "Everton":            { bg: "#000198", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "EVE" },
  "Fulham":             { bg: "#0C0803", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "FUL" },
  "Leeds":              { bg: "#273A8A", fg: "#F9D849", abbr: "LEE" },
  "Liverpool":          { bg: "#D13630", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "LIV" },
  "Man City":           { bg: "#A1C4E6", fg: "#051736", abbr: "MCI" },
  "Man Utd":            { bg: "#C93530", fg: "#1A1A1A", abbr: "MUN" },
  "Newcastle":          { bg: "#000000", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "NEW" },
  "Nottingham Forest":  { bg: "#BB271A", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "NFO" },
  "Sunderland":         { bg: "#CA2D25", fg: "#FFFFFF", abbr: "SUN" },
  "Tottenham":          { bg: "#FFFFFF", fg: "#020C49", abbr: "TOT" },
  "West Ham":           { bg: "#651825", fg: "#54AFE2", abbr: "WHU" },
  "Wolves":             { bg: "#F3BC44", fg: "#181617", abbr: "WOL" }
}

Implementation requirements:
1) Create a reusable UI component, e.g. <TeamBadge teamName="Arsenal" size="sm|md|lg" /> that renders:
   - A circular (or rounded) badge
   - Background colour = TEAM_STYLE_MAP[teamName].bg
   - Text = TEAM_STYLE_MAP[teamName].abbr (uppercase)
   - Text colour = TEAM_STYLE_MAP[teamName].fg
   - Font weight bold, slightly condensed/compact, centered
   - Null-safe: if teamName not found, fall back to a neutral bg (#2B2B2B) and fg (#FFFFFF) and abbreviation from a safe computed fallback (first 3 letters of teamName if present, else “---”).

2) Replace team crest usage on the Teams page with this TeamBadge component.
   - Ensure layout spacing stays consistent with current design.
   - Ensure contrast is good; Tottenham will be white bg with dark text, so the badge may need a subtle border (e.g. 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)) ONLY when bg is white/light to remain visible on white cards. Do not globally add borders to all badges.

3) Player avatar initials circles (Team Hub > Injuries list):
   - Identify the component used to render the player initials circle (likely an Avatar/Initials component).
   - Apply:
     - inner circle background = player.team bg
     - initials text colour = player.team fg
   - MUST preserve the injury “ring” (status border/outline) around the avatar:
     - Do not overwrite the ring’s border color, ring class, box-shadow, outline, or pseudo-element logic.
     - If the ring is implemented via a wrapper element, apply team background/text only to the INNER circle element.
     - If ring is implemented via border on the same element, refactor so ring lives on wrapper and fill lives on inner element.

4) Data plumbing:
   - Ensure player objects reliably expose teamName (or teamId that can be mapped to teamName).
   - If you have team IDs/slugs elsewhere, add a mapping resolver function:
     - getTeamStyle(teamNameOrSlugOrId) -> { bg, fg, abbr }
   - Null-safe everywhere (no crashes if a team is missing).

5) Acceptance criteria:
   - No team crests visible on Teams page; all replaced with colour abbreviation badges.
   - Injury tab player circles show team colours + initials while ring colour remains tied to injury status as before.
   - No regressions in spacing, alignment, or mobile layout.
   - Works across all teams in the supplied table.
   - For Tottenham (white bg), badge is still visible on white backgrounds (conditional border only when needed).

Proceed to implement, update the relevant components and usage sites, and run through a quick visual check in mobile + desktop widths.
