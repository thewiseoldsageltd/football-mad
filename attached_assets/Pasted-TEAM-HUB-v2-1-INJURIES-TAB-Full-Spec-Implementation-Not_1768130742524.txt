TEAM HUB v2.1 — INJURIES TAB (Full Spec + Implementation Notes)

Context:
- We already have Team Hub v2 layout working with tabs:
  /teams/:teamSlug (Latest default)
  /teams/:teamSlug/injuries
  /teams/:teamSlug/transfers
  /teams/:teamSlug/matches
  /teams/:teamSlug/fans
- Keep everything filtered to News for now (no new competition hub pages yet).
- Goal: Make /injuries feel like a premium “team destination” with clear status + confidence, without clutter.

PRIMARY GOALS
1) Make injuries instantly scannable: OUT / DOUBTFUL / RETURN DATE / CONFIDENCE.
2) Keep styling consistent with Team Hub v2 (hero stays, right rail stays).
3) Build robust empty/loading/error states.
4) Ensure URL-driven active tab state is the single source of truth (already done).

ROUTING
- /teams/:teamSlug/injuries renders the Injuries view inside Team Hub template.
- Clicking the Injuries tab navigates to /teams/:teamSlug/injuries.
- Clicking Latest always navigates back to /teams/:teamSlug (no /latest path).
- Ensure navigation sets scroll to top on tab change (or preserve existing behavior if already consistent sitewide).

LAYOUT (Desktop)
- Keep the same structure as Team Hub v2:
  Left: main content column (injuries feed)
  Right rail: Follow card + Club newsletter card + “More from {Team}” (optional placement depending on existing layout)
- Injuries tab content should not feel sparse: add a header row with summary + small legend.

INJURIES TAB UI (Main Column)

A) Header / Summary Row
- Title: “Injuries & Availability”
- Subtext: “Latest squad availability for {TeamName}”
- Summary pills (small, neutral):
  - OUT: X
  - DOUBTFUL: Y
  - RETURNING SOON: Z (optional, based on expected return within 14 days)
- Add a “Last updated” timestamp (from injuries dataset, or fallback to now if not available).

B) Injury Cards Grid
- Use a responsive grid:
  - Desktop: 2 columns
  - Tablet: 2 columns (tight)
  - Mobile: 1 column
- Each injury card includes:
  1. Player name (bold)
  2. Position (small text) and Team name (optional if already implied)
  3. Status badge (high-contrast):
     - OUT (red)
     - DOUBTFUL (amber/orange)
     - AVAILABLE (green) — only show if dataset includes availability updates, otherwise omit
  4. Injury type (e.g., Hamstring, ACL)
  5. Expected return (text):
     - If exact date available: “Expected return: 12 Feb”
     - If approximate: “Expected return: Late Feb”
     - If unknown: “Expected return: TBD”
  6. Confidence meter:
     - Label: “Confidence”
     - Horizontal bar (0–100%) with subtle fill
     - Show % on the right (e.g., 70%)
  7. Source CTA (only if we have a URL/source):
     - Button style: secondary / outline
     - Copy: “Official club statement” (or “Source” if generic)
     - Opens in new tab

Card interactions:
- Hover: slight lift + shadow (match Team Hub v2 interaction style).
- Entire card should NOT be clickable if there’s no detail page. Only CTA button clickable.

C) Optional: “Injury News” module (below cards)
- Keep “filtered to News” approach:
  - Add a “Injury-related news” row beneath injuries cards:
    - Pull last 3–6 articles tagged with team + “injury” keyword (or category if exists)
  - Layout: compact horizontal cards or standard article cards (reuse existing)
  - This stops the page feeling empty when injuries dataset is small.

RIGHT RAIL (Keep consistent)
1) Follow {TeamName} card (as already implemented)
2) {NewsletterName} (e.g., Gunners Mad) subscription card
3) Optional: “More from {TeamName}” (keep if already present across tabs)

DATA + LOGIC
- Data model should support:
  playerName
  status (OUT | DOUBTFUL | AVAILABLE | SUSPENDED optional)
  injuryType
  expectedReturn (string)
  confidence (0–100 number)
  sourceLabel (string optional)
  sourceUrl (url optional)
  updatedAt (date optional)
- Sorting priority:
  1) OUT first
  2) DOUBTFUL second
  3) RETURNING SOON (if used) third
  4) AVAILABLE last (if present)
  Within each group, sort by highest confidence or soonest return date (choose one and be consistent).

STATES
1) Loading:
- Show skeleton grid of 4–6 injury cards
- Show skeleton for summary row

2) Empty:
- Friendly empty state:
  Title: “No injury updates right now”
  Body: “We’ll post squad availability updates as soon as they’re confirmed.”
- Show Injury-related news module beneath (if available)

3) Error:
- Inline error panel:
  “Couldn’t load injury updates. Please try again.”
- Provide “Retry” button.

DESIGN CONSISTENCY
- Typography: match existing Team Hub (bold section title, clean spacing).
- Color usage:
  - Use brand green for positive actions and right-rail newsletter card background.
  - Status badges use strong semantic colours.
  - Keep surfaces clean: white cards, soft borders, subtle shadows.

SEO + METADATA
- Page title:
  “{TeamName} Injuries | Football Mad”
- Meta description:
  “Latest {TeamName} injury news and squad availability updates — return dates, status and confidence.”
- Canonical:
  /teams/{teamSlug}/injuries
- Ensure internal linking from the tab nav is standard <Link> and crawlable.

QA CHECKLIST
- Tab active state correct on hard refresh of /injuries
- Switching Injuries ↔ Transfers ↔ Matches keeps URL + active style synced
- Mobile: cards stack nicely, right rail drops below content
- No dead links or anchors; clicking any article elsewhere should open article at top

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
- Reuse existing TeamHub layout component.
- Implement <TeamInjuriesTab /> as the view.
- Ensure scroll-to-top behavior on route change (if not global, add in TeamHub nav click handler).

Deliverable:
- Injuries tab fully styled + connected to existing injuries logic/data, consistent with Team Hub v2.
