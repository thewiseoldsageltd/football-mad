We need to lock and implement a final availability taxonomy across Football Mad using the existing FPL feed.

GOAL
- Treatment Room (medical only) must reconcile counts exactly (Overview = sum of state tabs).
- Remove “Loans/Transfers” from Treatment Room entirely (move to Transfers tab).
- Move “Suspended” out of Treatment Room into a new Discipline tab (v1 supports Suspended only).
- Apply the same taxonomy to both Team Hub Injuries tab and the global Injuries page (H1 = Treatment Room, nav label stays Injuries).

FINAL TAXONOMY
1) Medical (Treatment Room):
- Returning Soon (75%)
- Coin Flip (50%)
- Doubtful (25%)
- Out (0%)
Overview count must equal Returning Soon + Coin Flip + Doubtful + Out.

2) Discipline:
- Suspended (only, for now)

3) Squad:
- Loaned / Transferred (moved to Transfers tab)

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

A) TEAM HUB CHANGES (important)
1) Update Team Hub Injuries tab:
- Tabs should be:
  - Overview
  - Returning Soon
  - Coin Flip
  - Doubtful
  - Out
- Remove any “Loans/Transfers” tab from Injuries.
- Remove “Suspended” from Injuries.
- Ensure Overview count is the sum of those 4 medical states and matches the displayed number.

2) Add a new Team Hub tab: “Discipline”
- v1 shows only “Suspended”
- Reuse existing player row/card styles; keep it simple and factual.
- If FPL doesn’t provide suspension detail beyond a flag/status, still list the player(s) with a “Suspended” badge and null-safe placeholders.

3) Transfers tab:
- Add/extend a “Loaned/Transferred” section driven by the FPL feed.
- These players should not appear anywhere in Treatment Room.
- Keep it clean: player name, destination/status if available, otherwise show “Loaned/Transferred”.

B) GLOBAL PAGE CHANGES
1) Main header nav remains “Injuries”.
2) Global page route remains /injuries, but:
- Page H1 must be “Treatment Room”
- It should aggregate medical statuses across ALL teams using the same rules as Team Hub:
  - Returning Soon (75%)
  - Coin Flip (50%)
  - Doubtful (25%)
  - Out (0%)
- Overview must reconcile to the sum of those states.
- Add Team filter dropdown (All teams + each team) and state tabs (Overview + 4 states).
- Do NOT include Suspended or Loaned/Transferred on this page.

3) Optional (if easy): Add a link or secondary nav to /transfers for “Loaned/Transferred” and to /discipline later, but only if routing already exists. Otherwise keep global injuries page medical-only.

DATA SPLITTING RULES (CRITICAL)
- “Loaned/Transferred” wins over medical: if a player is flagged as loaned/transferred, they must be excluded from Treatment Room even if chance/status exists.
- “Suspended” is excluded from Treatment Room and appears only in Discipline.
- Only players classified into one of the 4 medical states appear in Treatment Room.
- Null-safe rendering everywhere (no UI breaks if expected return/injury type missing).

UI CONSISTENCY
- Keep container width consistent with other hub pages (avoid narrow layout).
- Reuse the existing InjuryCard / availability UI styles and badges.
- Ensure counts on tabs and overview always match filtered results.

DELIVERABLES
- Team Hub Injuries tab updated to 4 medical tabs + Overview with correct counts.
- New Team Hub Discipline tab showing Suspended players (v1).
- Transfers tab includes Loaned/Transferred list sourced from FPL.
- Global /injuries page shows Treatment Room (medical-only) aggregated across all teams with tabs + team filter.
