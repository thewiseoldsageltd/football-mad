You are working in my repo (Replit). Please update the FA Cup Cups feature so the UI uses my canonical 14-round naming and only shows valid FA Cup rounds.

GOAL
Fix /api/cup/progress (FA Cup: competitionId=1198) so rounds are grouped and displayed using ONLY these canonical round names, in this exact order:

Qualifying (6):
1) Extra Preliminary Round
2) Preliminary Round
3) First Qualifying Round
4) Second Qualifying Round
5) Third Qualifying Round
6) Fourth Qualifying Round

Proper (8):
7) First Round
8) Second Round
9) Third Round
10) Fourth Round
11) Fifth Round
12) Quarter-finals
13) Semi-finals
14) Final

KEY RULES
1) Round normalization must return one of the 14 canonical names above, or null (meaning discard).
2) Any stage/round name that does NOT map must be ignored (this prevents spurious “team names as rounds” and polluting knockout rounds).
3) Keep season support (?season=2025/2026) and the current working Goalserve endpoint logic that returns JSON (and keep the HTML detection guard).
4) Ensure ordering is stable by mapping canonical names to an explicit order 1..14.

MAPPING REQUIREMENTS
- Goalserve fractional rounds must map like this:
  - "1/128-finals" => "First Round"
  - "1/64-finals"  => "Second Round"
  - "1/32-finals"  => "Third Round"
  - "1/16-finals"  => "Fourth Round"
  - "1/8-finals"   => "Fifth Round"
  - "quarter-finals" => "Quarter-finals"
  - "semi-finals" => "Semi-finals"
  - "final" => "Final"
- Goalserve qualifying text mapping (case-insensitive, tolerate “1st/first”, hyphens, etc):
  - contains "extra preliminary" => "Extra Preliminary Round"
  - contains "preliminary" (but not "extra") => "Preliminary Round"
  - contains "first qualifying" or "1st qualifying" => "First Qualifying Round"
  - contains "second qualifying" or "2nd qualifying" => "Second Qualifying Round"
  - contains "third qualifying" or "3rd qualifying" => "Third Qualifying Round"
  - contains "fourth qualifying" or "4th qualifying" => "Fourth Qualifying Round"

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Locate the code for /api/cup/progress in the server (likely server/routes.ts or similar).
- The parser currently iterates Goalserve shapes like:
  results.tournament.stage[].week[].match[]
  results.tournament.stage[].round[].match[]
  results.tournament.stage[].match[]
  Ensure we do NOT double-count matches if the same matches appear in more than one structure. Prefer a single canonical extraction path and dedupe by match id if needed.
- Build a dictionary keyed by canonicalRoundName -> matches[].
- For each match, decide the round name using the stage/round naming available in the feed; pass it through normalizeToCanonicalRound(name). If null, skip.
- Return JSON:
  { competitionId, season?, rounds: [{ name, order, matches: [...] }] }
  where name is the canonical display name and order is 1..14.
- Frontend: ensure the Cups tab displays the round name exactly as returned (these are already display-ready).
- Keep existing match sorting inside each round by kickoff datetime.

ADD A QUICK DEV NOTE
- Update docs/BUILD_LOG.md (or relevant doc) with:
  - the canonical round list
  - the mapping table for fractional rounds
  - the rule: “discard anything that doesn’t map”

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (do these yourself after changes)
- Hitting /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1198&season=2025/2026 returns rounds ONLY from the canonical list above.
- No massive “Quarter-finals” buckets with 80+ matches.
- Fractional rounds appear under the correct “First Round / Second Round / …” naming.

After implementing, show me:
1) the files changed
2) the new normalize function (or relevant snippet)
3) a sample response (first 1-2 rounds) from /api/cup/progress for FA Cup
