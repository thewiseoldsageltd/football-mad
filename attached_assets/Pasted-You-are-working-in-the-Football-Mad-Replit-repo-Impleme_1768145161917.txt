You are working in the Football Mad Replit repo. Implement the next UX iteration for the Team Hub > Injuries tab to mirror FPL decision-making.

GOAL
- Keep using the existing FPL availability ingestion (bootstrap-static sync) and existing DB table/model.
- Improve the Injuries tab UI/logic by:
  1) Replacing the “Lowest %” sort with FPL-manager-friendly filters
  2) Distinguishing between: Injuries, Suspensions, Loans/Transfers
  3) Defaulting the view to the most useful group (“Returning soon”)

REQUIREMENTS

A) DATA / CLASSIFICATION (server-side or shared utility)
Create a clear classification for each player availability row using existing fields:
- chanceThisRound (or the app’s chosen “display chance” which currently prioritizes next round)
- fplStatus
- news (string)

Define 3 top-level groups:
1. INJURY (availability risk due to injury/knock)
2. SUSPENSION (unavailable due to suspension)
3. LOAN_OR_TRANSFER (unavailable because they have joined another club on loan/permanently / left the club)

Rules:
- SUSPENSION if fplStatus === "s" (FPL suspended)
- LOAN_OR_TRANSFER if news text indicates player has left the club, e.g. contains any of:
  - "has joined"
  - "on loan"
  - "loan"
  - "permanently"
  - "joined" (case-insensitive)
  (Be careful not to misclassify “joined training” etc — prefer “has joined” and “on loan” and “permanently” as strongest signals; use “joined" only if paired with a club name or “on loan/permanently”.)
- Otherwise treat as INJURY when:
  - (displayChance !== 100) OR (news contains "injury" / "knock" / "hamstring" / "ankle" etc)
- If chance is null but fplStatus != "a" OR news present, treat as INJURY unless it matches LOAN_OR_TRANSFER or SUSPENSION.

Also create an “availability bucket” for INJURY group, based on DISPLAY CHANCE:
- RETURNING_SOON: 75% (and optionally 100% with injury news, but 100% usually healthy)
- COIN_FLIP: 50%
- DOUBTFUL: 25% or <50%
- OUT: 0% (injury-related)
For non-injury groups:
- SUSPENSION bucket: SUSPENDED
- LOAN_OR_TRANSFER bucket: LEFT_CLUB

B) UI CHANGES (client)
On /teams/:teamSlug/injuries (Team Hub Injuries tab):
1) Replace the “Lowest %” toggle with a small filter control set. Use pills/tabs aligned with current UI style:
   - “Returning soon” (DEFAULT)
   - “Coin flip”
   - “Doubtful”
   - “Out”
   - “Suspended”
   - “Loans/Transfers”
2) Each filter shows only the matching players:
   - Returning soon: injury bucket RETURNING_SOON (75%)
   - Coin flip: injury bucket COIN_FLIP (50%)
   - Doubtful: injury bucket DOUBTFUL (<50 and >0)
   - Out: injury bucket OUT (0) AND classification INJURY
   - Suspended: classification SUSPENSION
   - Loans/Transfers: classification LOAN_OR_TRANSFER
3) Keep the existing “Most Recent” sorting (as default), but ensure within each filter results are sorted by:
   - Most recent update first (newsAdded desc if available, else updated/lastSyncedAt)
   - Tie-breaker: lower chance first (for injury filters only)
4) Summary chips near the top (next to OUT count) should become:
   - OUT (injury OUT only, 0% and INJURY)
   - DOUBTFUL (<=75 and >=50? OR specifically 75? — follow FPL: 75 is doubtful, 50 is injured, 25 is injured, 0 is out. So:
        - DOUBTFUL count = players with 75% in INJURY bucket RETURNING_SOON
        - INJURED count = players with 50/25/0 in INJURY group (optional; if too busy, skip)
     )
   - SUSPENDED count
   - LOANED OUT count
Keep it clean—no more than 3-4 summary chips.

C) VISUAL CONSISTENCY
- Keep the avatar circle (initials) on cards (no percentage circle).
- The avatar ring color should reflect the FPL-style statuses:
  - 100% healthy/no issue: green ring (but these usually shouldn’t appear in the injuries list unless news indicates issue)
  - 75%: amber ring (doubtful)
  - 50%: orange/amber ring (coin flip)
  - 25%: red ring (doubtful)
  - 0% injury: red ring
  - Suspended: red ring + small “Suspended” label
  - Loan/Transfer: grey ring + small “Loan/Transfer” label
Use existing Tailwind palette; avoid introducing brand new colors beyond typical tailwind semantic colors.
- Ensure the text line reads cleanly and uses ONE percentage:
  e.g. “Muscle injury — 75% chance”
  If percentage is null and suspension/loan: show “Suspended” or “Loaned out / Joined X”
  Keep the FPL news text visible and accurate.

D) DATA DISPLAY CHANCE CONSISTENCY
- Use the same “display chance” everywhere (the one you chose after fixing mismatch: prioritizing next round chance over this round chance).
- Make sure the displayed percentage matches the value used for filtering and ring colors.

E) IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Locate the Team injuries route/component and update it. Keep code modular.
- If there’s an existing utility like getRagColor(), refactor it so it returns:
  - classification
  - bucket
  - ringColor token
  - displayPercent string (or null)
- Update any server endpoint used by this page if necessary to return classification/bucket precomputed, OR compute client-side if already fetching all rows.
- Do NOT break other pages/tabs.

F) QA / ACCEPTANCE
- For Arsenal, Piero Hincapie should show 75% and be amber (doubtful), matching FPL.
- Players with “has joined … on loan/permanently” should appear under Loans/Transfers with grey ring and should NOT inflate OUT injury count.
- Suspended players should appear under Suspended and not under injury OUT.
- “Returning soon” should be the default selected filter.
- Page should still support sorting by most recent update.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes, ensure build passes, and leave a short note in BUILD_LOG.md describing what changed (1-2 paragraphs).
