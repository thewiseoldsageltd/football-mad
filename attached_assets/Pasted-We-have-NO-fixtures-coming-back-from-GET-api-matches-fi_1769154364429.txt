We have NO fixtures coming back from:
GET /api/matches/fixtures?days=7
It returns [].

Goal:
Fix the backend fixtures/results/live endpoints so they return matches correctly based on kickoff_time and real Goalserve status values.

Constraints:
- Only change server/routes.ts (and helper/query code if needed).
- Do NOT change ingestion jobs right now.
- Keep response shape the same.
- Must remain fast (use indexes already present on kickoff_time).

Step A — Diagnose quickly in code
1) Find the handlers for:
   GET /api/matches/fixtures
   GET /api/matches/results
   GET /api/matches/live
2) Identify current filters for status and time window.

Step B — Make the fixtures endpoint robust
Fixtures should include matches that have kickoff_time within the next N days AND are not finished.
Because Goalserve statuses vary, treat these statuses as “upcoming”:
- scheduled
- not_started
- ns
- postponed
- delayed
- TBD / TBA (if present)
Also, some feeds may use empty status for scheduled — handle that too.

Implement fixtures filter as:
- kickoff_time >= NOW()  (server time)
- kickoff_time < NOW() + interval '${days} days'
- status NOT IN ('finished', 'ft', 'full_time', 'ended', 'final')  (case-insensitive)
This is safer than only checking status='scheduled'.

Step C — Make results endpoint robust
Results should include matches within past N days AND are finished.
Treat these as “finished”:
- finished
- ft
- full_time
- ended
- final

Filter:
- kickoff_time >= NOW() - interval '${days} days'
- kickoff_time < NOW()
- status IN finished set (case-insensitive)

Step D — Live endpoint robust
Live matches:
Statuses often look like:
- live
- inplay
- in_play
- 1h / 2h
- halftime / ht
- extra_time / et
- penalties / pen
Implement a case-insensitive live status set OR numeric minute-based status if present.
If we don’t have minute statuses stored, at least match:
live/inplay/in_play/ht/halftime/et/extra_time/pen/penalties

Step E — Timezone sanity
kickoff_time is timestamp without time zone.
Ensure comparisons use consistent server time.
If the app runs in UTC but kickoff_time is effectively UTC, NOW() is fine.
If mismatch is suspected, use NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' for comparisons.
Pick ONE approach and apply consistently across fixtures/results/live.

Step F — Add temporary debug switch (so we can verify quickly)
If query param debug=1 is present on /api/matches/fixtures,
return extra fields:
- nowServer
- nowUtc
- days
- countFutureAll (count of matches with kickoff_time >= now)
- sampleNext5 (kickoff_time + status + competition for next 5 matches ordered by kickoff_time)

Step G — Verification steps (output in summary)
After changes, these should work:
1) curl -sS "http://localhost:5000/api/matches/fixtures?days=7&debug=1" | head -c 1200
2) curl -sS "http://localhost:5000/api/matches/fixtures?days=30" | head -c 400
3) curl -sS "http://localhost:5000/api/matches/results?days=7" | head -c 400

Deliverables:
- Give me the exact diff/summary of the code change.
- Explain which filter was causing [].
