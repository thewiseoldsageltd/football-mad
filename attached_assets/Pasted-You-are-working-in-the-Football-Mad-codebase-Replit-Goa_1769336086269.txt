You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Replit). Goal: Add FA Cup (England) support to the Tables page under a new “Cups” tab, using Goalserve competitionId 1198, showing tournament progress grouped by round.

REQUIREMENTS
1) UI
- On /tables, add a top-level segment/tab called “Cups” alongside “Leagues” and “Europe” (match existing styling).
- Under Cups, add a selectable cup chip/tab: “FA Cup”.
- When FA Cup is selected, render a “Cup progress” view (NOT league standings).
- Cup progress view must show fixtures/results grouped by round (e.g., Third Round, Fourth Round, Fifth Round, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Final).
- Each match row shows: Home team, Away team, score (if played), kick-off datetime (if scheduled), and status (FT/HT/NS etc if available).
- Keep the UI responsive; on mobile, group headers + compact match rows.

2) Data + API
- Add a backend endpoint: GET /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1198&season=2025/2026
- This endpoint should fetch Goalserve data and return normalized JSON grouped by round.
- Use the existing Goalserve feed key env var + HTTP fetch pattern already used by standings ingestion.
- IMPORTANT: Do not require ingestion jobs for MVP; fetch live from Goalserve for now (we’ll cache later).

3) Goalserve feed
- Use a Goalserve cup/fixtures feed appropriate for FA Cup based on existing patterns in the repo.
- If the repo already has a “fixtures by league/competition” fetcher, reuse it.
- If not, implement a minimal fetcher in server:
  - Call Goalserve using competitionId=1198 and season when supported.
  - Parse JSON structure to extract:
    - round name (or stage/round label)
    - match list
    - teams
    - score
    - datetime
    - status
- Normalize round naming:
  - “Quarter-finals” (not “Quarter Finals”)
  - “Semi-finals”
  - “Final”
- Sort rounds in correct order (early rounds first, final last). Within a round, sort by datetime ascending.

4) Config / Wiring
- Add FA Cup to the client competition config:
  - id/slug: "fa-cup"
  - name: "FA Cup"
  - country: "England"
  - goalserveCompetitionId: "1198"
  - type: "cup"
- Ensure selecting “Cups → FA Cup” triggers the new endpoint and renders results.

5) QA / Verification
- Add a small dev helper curl in docs (or comment) to verify:
  curl -sS "$DOMAIN/api/cup/progress?competitionId=1198&season=2025/2026" | head -n 80
- Confirm /tables → Cups → FA Cup loads without errors and displays grouped rounds.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT break existing Leagues tables.
- Keep the code style consistent with existing fetch hooks/components.
- Keep it MVP: no bracket graphics yet, no caching yet, no pagination yet.

IMPLEMENTATION HINTS (use if helpful)
- Create/extend a shared type like:
  CupRound { name: string; order: number; matches: CupMatch[] }
  CupMatch { home: { id? name }, away: { id? name }, score?: { home, away }, kickoff?: string, status?: string }
- Frontend: a <CupProgress /> component rendered only when active competition.type === "cup".
- Backend: place endpoint near other public API routes, and reuse existing Goalserve fetch util if present.

Deliver: Code changes only. After implementation, provide a short summary of files changed and how to test.
