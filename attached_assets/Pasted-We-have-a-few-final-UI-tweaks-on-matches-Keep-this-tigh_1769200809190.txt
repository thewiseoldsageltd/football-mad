We have a few final UI tweaks on /matches. Keep this tight: implement + typecheck + quick manual check. NO long test loops.

A) DESKTOP — One fixture per row + faint divider between competitions
1) Change the matches grid/list so desktop is SINGLE column (1 card per line), not 2-column.
   - If there is a grid like `md:grid-cols-2` / `lg:grid-cols-2`, remove it and keep `grid-cols-1` always.
2) Add a subtle divider between competition groups:
   - When rendering grouped competitions in `MatchesList.tsx`, insert a thin divider between groups (not between each match).
   - Use Tailwind like: `border-t border-gray-200/60 dark:border-white/10 my-6` or equivalent.
   - Do NOT add heavy headings; keep it faint and clean.

B) MOBILE — Center text, arrow right aligned in dropdown triggers (consistent with site)
Currently we centered the whole trigger which also centers the chevron. Fix:
1) For Filter and Sort triggers, keep:
   - text centered
   - chevron icon pinned to the right
2) Implement by making trigger `relative` and absolutely positioning chevron:
   - Trigger: `relative`
   - Text container: `w-full text-center`
   - Chevron: `absolute right-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
3) Apply on mobile only (base), preserve desktop default with `sm:` overrides if necessary.

C) REMOVE ALL “(Country)” BRACKETS EVERYWHERE (pill + dropdown + cards)
We should never show “(England)” (or any country) in brackets.
1) Find label builder (likely in `MatchesList.tsx` disambiguation logic):
   - Default label must be JUST league name (e.g. “Championship”).
2) Collision case (same league name appears for multiple countries in the current list):
   - Still no brackets.
   - Use: “Championship • England” (muted bullet separator) OR a second muted line with the country.
   - Keep pill flag visible either way.
3) Ensure this applies both to:
   - Match cards’ competition pill
   - Filter dropdown options

D) MOBILE — Reduce team-name truncation by aligning names closer to kickoff time
Goal: maximize usable width for both team names on mobile.
1) In the match card layout on small screens:
   - Put home crest + name in a left block that ends near the center.
   - Put away crest + name in a right block that starts near the center.
   - Kickoff time stays centered.
2) Practical approach (small screen):
   - Use 3-column grid: `grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` for the “main row”.
   - Home block: `min-w-0 flex items-center gap-2 justify-end` (name hugs center)
   - Away block: `min-w-0 flex items-center gap-2 justify-start` (name hugs center)
   - Keep truncate on names, but this will give them more room.
   - Ensure away side still doesn’t overflow: add `min-w-0` + `truncate` + `overflow-hidden`.

FILES TO CHANGE (likely):
- `client/src/components/MatchesList.tsx`
  - force single-column
  - add divider between competition groups
  - remove bracketed country in labels (and implement collision formatting without brackets)
- `client/src/components/EnhancedMatchCard.tsx`
  - mobile layout tweaks for name alignment (hug center)
- `client/src/pages/matches.tsx` (or shared Select component)
  - trigger layout: centered text + chevron right aligned on mobile

VALIDATION (do only this):
- run `npm run typecheck` (or repo equivalent)
- quick manual check:
  - desktop: one card per row + subtle divider between competitions
  - mobile: centered text, chevron right, no “(Country)” anywhere, improved name spacing, no bleed/overflow
