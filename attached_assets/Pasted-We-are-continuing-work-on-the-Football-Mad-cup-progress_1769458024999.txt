We are continuing work on the Football Mad cup progress system.

IMPORTANT WORKING RULES:

• The user is NOT editing files directly.
• Return ALL code updates as ONE Replit AI prompt in a single copy-paste code block.
• DO NOT perform regression testing.
• DO NOT refactor FA Cup or EFL Cup logic.
• DO NOT touch unrelated competitions.
• DO NOT add logging, debug endpoints, or test scripts.
• Do NOT change UI behaviour.

CONTEXT / EVIDENCE (Goalserve Copa del Rey 1397 stage names):

Goalserve soccerfixtures/leagueid/1397 contains stages:
- 1/128-finals
- 1/64-finals
- 1/32-finals
- 1/16-finals
- 1/8-finals
- Quarter-finals
(and later likely Semi-finals, Final)

TASK (backend only, /api/cup/progress only):

For competitionId = 1397 (Copa del Rey), update ONLY the round/stage label normalisation so these Goalserve stage names map to our canonical rounds:

Mappings (case-insensitive, ignore whitespace/punctuation):

- "1/128-finals"  -> "First Round"
- "1/64-finals"   -> "Second Round"   (if your Copa canonical list does not include Second Round, add it ONLY for Copa 1397 seeding)
- "1/32-finals"   -> "Round of 32"
- "1/16-finals"   -> "Round of 16"
- "1/8-finals"    -> "Round of 16"    (Copa’s 1/8-finals is the last-16 stage shown on Soccerway)
- Anything containing "quarter" OR exact "1/4-finals" -> "Quarter-finals"
- Anything containing "semi" -> "Semi-finals"
- Anything containing "final" but NOT semi-final -> "Final"

Important: this mapping must apply whether the label comes from:
- stage.name
- round.name
- week.name
(or any equivalent label field you currently use for cup round naming)

Also ensure Copa del Rey canonical seeding list includes at least:
First Round, Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Final
(and include Second Round ONLY if you are mapping 1/64-finals to it; otherwise map 1/64-finals to First Round and keep the canonical list unchanged).

CONSTRAINTS:

• Do NOT modify UI.
• Do NOT modify FA Cup/EFL Cup logic.
• Keep changes scoped to competitionId 1397 normalisation / seeding only.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:

Return ONE backend code update prompt only.
No explanations outside the code block.
