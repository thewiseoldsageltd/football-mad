Fix the Predicted Lineups layout. The pitch is currently overflowing the card and breaking the page flow. Refactor so the entire module is strictly contained inside the card with a fixed height and no overflow.

Non-negotiables

Nothing in PredictedLineups may use position: absolute for overall layout (only allowed for placing players inside the pitch canvas).

The card must clip children: add overflow-hidden to the main card wrapper.

The layout must be a true 3-column grid on desktop:

Left: Home XI

Middle: Pitch

Right: Away XI

Hard constraints (stop the pitch escaping)

Wrap the three columns in a container with a fixed height:

Desktop: h-[520px] (or min-h + max-h if preferred, but must be bounded)

Example: <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 h-[520px]"> ... </div>

Pitch column must be fully constrained:

Wrapper: h-full w-full overflow-hidden flex items-center justify-center

Pitch element (svg/div): h-full w-full max-h-full max-w-full

Enforce portrait ratio: use aspect-[3/5] on the pitch itself and h-full so it scales DOWN not UP.

Example pitch wrapper:

<div className="h-full w-full overflow-hidden flex items-center justify-center">

<div className="h-full aspect-[3/5] max-w-full"> ...pitch... </div>

Lists must not change card height

Left + right columns must be h-full flex flex-col and the XI list area must scroll:

List container: flex-1 overflow-y-auto

Subs footer: pinned at bottom inside the column: mt-3 pt-3 border-t text-xs text-muted-foreground

Away list formatting (numbers on the outside)

Away team rows must be right aligned with number on the far right:

Structure each row: [name][number]

Use flex justify-end gap-3

Name: text-right

Number: w-6 text-right tabular-nums

Mobile

Mobile layout should be:

First: Home XI | Away XI side-by-side (2 columns) inside one bounded card section

Second: Pitch below with h-[420px] overflow-hidden flex justify-center

Debug checklist

Ensure the pitch wrapper is NOT absolute and NOT fixed

Ensure the grid parent has a fixed height (h-[520px])

Ensure the card has overflow-hidden

Ensure the pitch element uses aspect-[3/5] and h-full so it scales to the grid height

Make these changes directly in the PredictedLineups component and any pitch subcomponent it uses.
