You are working in a Node/TS backend for Football Mad. We need to fix Matches page ordering by making the /api/matches/day debug output useful and by hardening priority sorting so only exact (country, league) matches can land in Tier 0/1/2.

CONTEXT:
- Current endpoint: GET /api/matches/day?date=YYYY-MM-DD&status=all|live|scheduled|fulltime&sort=competition|kickoff&debug=1
- Right now debug=1 replaces the response with metadata only (date/start/end/returnedCount/sampleFirst5). There is no topSamples.
- The UI ordering is still wrong (e.g. "Championship" from non-England sometimes appears top).
- We need to be explicit: Tier 0 includes UEFA comps + England leagues/cups; Tier 1 big 5; Tier 2 Scotland. Youth/reserve must be demoted.

GOALS:
1) Change debug behavior: debug=1 should NOT replace the response. It should return the normal response (matches array) PLUS a "debug" object.
2) Add "debug.topSamples" containing the first 50 matches AFTER sorting, but each entry should include:
   - id, kickoffTime, status, competition (raw), goalserveCompetitionId
   - parsedCountry, parsedLeague (from competition string)
   - leagueKey used for priority lookup
   - priority number
   - sortKey tuple (priority, compName, kickoffTime) used in comparator
3) Add "debug.leagueSummary": counts per leagueKey for the day (top 30) to see what leagues exist and their computed priorities.
4) HARDEN parsing + priority:
   - NEVER default missing country to "England"
   - Normalize country + league names to lowercase, trimmed
   - leagueKey MUST be `${countryNorm}|${leagueNorm}` when country is present
   - If country cannot be parsed, set countryNorm="unknown"
   - If leagueNorm is ambiguous (e.g. "championship", "premier league", "league one", "league two", "national league") and countryNorm="unknown", force priority to 9000 (bottom) to avoid incorrect Tier 0 matches.
5) Implement explicit tier map (exact key matches only):
   Tier 0 (0-100):
     uefa|champions league
     uefa|europa league
     uefa|conference league
     england|premier league
     england|championship
     england|league one
     england|league two
     england|national league
     england|fa cup
     england|efl cup
     england|carabao cup  (treat as same as efl cup)
   Tier 1 (200-299):
     spain|la liga
     italy|serie a
     germany|bundesliga
     france|ligue 1
     netherlands|eredivisie
   Tier 2 (300-399):
     scotland|premiership
     scotland|championship
     scotland|scottish cup
   Defaults:
     - unknown leagues: 1000
     - youth/reserve/u21/u19/u18/u23/reserve/academy/friendly competitions: 9000
   IMPORTANT: Youth demotion must trigger if the competition name includes: "u21","u23","u19","u18","youth","reserve","reserves","academy","premier league 2","premier league cup"
6) Sorting modes:
   - sort=competition: primarily by (priority asc), then (competitionDisplayName asc), then kickoffTime asc
   - sort=kickoff: primarily by kickoffTime asc, then priority asc, then competitionDisplayName asc
   Ensure priorities are numbers and comparator is stable.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Edit server route handler for /api/matches/day in server/routes.ts (or whichever file defines it).
- There is already competition parsing logic; replace it with a single helper:
   parseCompetition(competitionString) -> { countryNorm, leagueNorm, competitionDisplayName }
   It should handle:
     "Name (Country) [ID]" => league=Name, country=Country
     "Country: Name" => league=Name, country=Country
     "UEFA Europa League" => country=UEFA, league=Europa League (treat countryNorm="uefa")
   If no country present -> countryNorm="unknown"
- Add helpers:
   isYouthCompetition(competitionLower)
   getPriority(countryNorm, leagueNorm, competitionLower)
- Make sure the endpoint always returns:
   { matches: MatchDTO[], ...existing fields if any..., debug?: {...} }
   If you currently return an array, wrap it in an object so we can include debug.
   Update frontend fetch accordingly ONLY IF needed (but prefer to keep response shape consistent with existing non-debug call).
   If changing shape is risky, then:
     - keep existing response for non-debug
     - for debug only, return { matches, debug, ...meta }
- Add tests or at least a quick local verification:
   curl ".../api/matches/day?date=2026-01-23&status=all&sort=competition&debug=1"
   should include debug.topSamples with computed priorities.

DELIVERABLES:
- Commit-ready code changes.
- A brief note in the response: exactly where to look in the debug payload to see computed priorities, and how to confirm "england|championship" is not being applied to Indonesia/Poland "Championship".

DO NOT:
- Do not use jq.
- Do not install new dependencies.
- Do not handwave; implement actual code and ensure it compiles.
