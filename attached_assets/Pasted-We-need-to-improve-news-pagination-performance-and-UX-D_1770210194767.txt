We need to improve /news pagination performance and UX.

DO NOT run end-to-end tests.
DO NOT generate videos.
Keep changes focused to the files mentioned.

PROBLEM
- Load more now correctly adds 15 posts, but it takes ~1 minute to respond.
- UX feels like the button is dead, causing repeated clicks and frustration.
- Backend uses ORDER BY COALESCE(sourceUpdatedAt, publishedAt, createdAt), which is hard to index and can be slow.

GOALS
1) Frontend: immediate visible feedback when clicking "Load more" (instant loading state + skeleton placeholders), plus a timeout + clear error message.
2) Backend: make pagination query fast via a single indexed sort column (sortAt) and a stable cursor using (sortAt, id).

IMPLEMENTATION

A) BACKEND PERFORMANCE

1) shared/schema.ts (or wherever the article table is defined)
- Add a new column on articles table:
  sortAt: timestamp (or datetime string consistent with your DB)
- Ensure it is populated for ALL articles:
  sortAt = sourceUpdatedAt ?? publishedAt ?? createdAt
- Add an index on sortAt (and ideally a composite index on (sortAt, id) if supported).

2) server/storage.ts (news query)
- Stop ordering by COALESCE(...) directly.
- Order by sortAt DESC, then id DESC as tiebreaker.
- Cursor should include both sortAt and id for stability.
  Example cursor encoding: `${sortAt}|${id}` (URL-encoded)
- For next page:
  WHERE (sortAt < cursorSortAt) OR (sortAt = cursorSortAt AND id < cursorId)
- Fetch limit + 1 to compute hasMore.

3) server/routes.ts
- Parse cursor into sortAt + id.
- Validate format; if invalid, return 400 with helpful message.

4) Ensure upsert logic (Ghost sync + webhook sync) sets sortAt correctly whenever sourceUpdatedAt/publishedAt/createdAt changes.

B) FRONTEND UX

File: client/src/pages/news.tsx

1) Add clear instant visual feedback:
- When user clicks Load more:
  - immediately set loading state
  - immediately append 15 skeleton placeholders to the grid (so it looks responsive)
- When response arrives:
  - remove the 15 skeletons
  - append real articles

2) Add a timeout with AbortController:
- Abort fetch after 20 seconds.
- If aborted/failed:
  - remove skeletons
  - show a small inline error message near the button: "Couldn’t load more posts. Try again."
  - re-enable button

3) Add "Still working..." helper text if loading exceeds 3 seconds.

4) Ensure we do NOT allow multiple concurrent loadMore calls (keep the ref guard already added).

DELIVERABLES
- Code changes applied.
- No secrets logged.
- No E2E tests or videos.
- After change, clicking "Load more" should feel instant (skeletons), and API should return much faster due to indexed sortAt pagination.
