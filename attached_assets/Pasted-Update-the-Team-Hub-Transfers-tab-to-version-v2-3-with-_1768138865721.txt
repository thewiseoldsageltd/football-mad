Update the Team Hub → Transfers tab to version v2.3 with the following product and UX decisions applied.

GOALS
- Reduce noise and cognitive load
- Prioritise clarity, scannability, and fan usefulness
- Align player data and conventions with FPL standards
- Design for rumours-first now, confirmed deals later

STRUCTURE
1. Transfers Header
- Title: “Transfers”
- Subtitle: “Latest rumours and links for [Team Name]”
- Show current window label (e.g. “January Window”)
- Show “Last updated” timestamp

2. In / Out / Net Summary
- HIDE this entire section by default
- ONLY render In / Out / Net when at least one CONFIRMED transfer exists
- Do not show this summary for rumours-only states

3. Rumours & Links (Primary Section)
- This is the default and main content area

PLAYER CARD DESIGN (v2.3)
Each rumour card must include:

LEFT
- Circular player headshot (40–48px)
- Fallback to initials avatar if image unavailable

CENTER
- Player name (bold)
- Player position using FPL shortcodes ONLY:
  - GKP, DEF, MID, FWD
- Confidence bar showing likelihood of move (percentage + progress bar)

RIGHT / INLINE
- Proposed transfer visual:
  - Source club crest SVG → arrow → destination club crest SVG
- Crests must be SVG icons, not text
- Subtle hover interaction optional

REMOVED ELEMENTS
- REMOVE “Linked In” pill
- REMOVE Tier A / B / C pills
- REMOVE any redundant metadata that requires explanation

CONFIDENCE
- Confidence % bar is the PRIMARY signal of likelihood
- Keep this prominent and visually clean

OPTIONAL TEXT (LOW PRIORITY)
- At most ONE subtle descriptor if needed (e.g. “Early link”, “Strong interest”)
- Do not stack multiple labels

SIDEBAR (UNCHANGED)
- Follow Team card (login gated)
- Club-specific newsletter card:
  - Use club branding and naming (e.g. “Gunners Mad”, “Spurs Mad”)
- “More from [Team]” links

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- No legends required to understand the UI
- Everything should be scannable in under 3 seconds
- Optimised for mobile and desktop
- Premium, calm, editorial feel

FUTURE-PROOFING (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)
- Confirmed Deals section (for later)
- Window Summary (when meaningful)
- Data ingestion hooks will be added later

VERSION
- Label this internally as: Team Hub Transfers v2.3
