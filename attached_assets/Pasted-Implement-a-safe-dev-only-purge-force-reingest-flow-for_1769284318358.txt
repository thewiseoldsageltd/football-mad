Implement a safe dev-only purge + force reingest flow for standings snapshots, so we can replace earlier bad Championship snapshots that stored null teamIds (showing team names as numbers like "9227").

GOAL:
- Add a protected endpoint/job to purge standings snapshots for a given leagueId + season.
- Add a force mode to upsert-goalserve-standings so we can override the "skipped" optimization.
- After purge + ingest, the /api/standings response must have no team.id null and no numeric-only team.name values.

CHANGES REQUIRED:

A) Add purge endpoint (protected)
- In server/routes.ts (or wherever your job routes live), add:
  POST /api/jobs/purge-standings?leagueId=XXXX&season=YYYY/YYYY
  Requires header "x-sync-secret" to match GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET (same as other jobs).
- It should delete, in the correct order:
  1) standings rows for all snapshots matching leagueId+season
  2) standings snapshots matching leagueId+season
- Return JSON: { ok: true, leagueId, season, deletedSnapshotsCount, deletedRowsCount }

Notes:
- Use your existing DB layer. If your schema has tables like standings_snapshots + standings_rows, delete rows first, then snapshots.
- If your schema names differ, locate the tables used by upsert-goalserve-standings.ts and purge those.

B) Add force param to upsert-goalserve-standings
- In server/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings.ts:
  - Accept query param force=1 from the route calling it (or accept an options arg).
  - If force=1, bypass "skipped" behavior and ALWAYS write a new snapshot + rows.

C) Ensure numeric team names never persist
- In getTeamDisplayName():
  - If the derived name is numeric-only (e.g. "9227"), treat as missing and fallback to `Team ${goalserveTeamId}`.
- When inserting teams, always store a non-numeric name (fallback as above).

ACCEPTANCE TEST:
1) Purge Championship standings:
   POST /api/jobs/purge-standings?leagueId=1205&season=2025/2026  (with x-sync-secret header)
2) Re-ingest with force:
   POST /api/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings?leagueId=1205&force=1  (with x-sync-secret header)
3) GET /api/standings?leagueId=1205&season=2025/2026 should contain:
   - no `"id":null`
   - no `"name":"9227"` (worst case should be `"name":"Team 9227"` until we enrich)

Do not change client code in this prompt.
