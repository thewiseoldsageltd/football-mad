GOAL
Unify round navigation across all competitions (Leagues + Europe) using ONE reusable “RoundToggle” (prev/next arrows + label + date range). Replace the current Europe MD button grid with the toggle. Add the same toggle to domestic league tables (Tables > Leagues) and show a right-hand fixtures/results sidebar in the same layout style as UCL. Default the selected round to the latest round that has any matches (FT/LIVE/SCHEDULED) for that competition/season.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep existing styling conventions (shadcn Button, existing Card layouts, dark mode).
- Do not reintroduce scroll-within-scroll for the fixtures list. The fixtures card should expand naturally down the page.
- The label should vary by competition:
  - Europe (UCL/UEL/UECL): “Matchday”
  - Domestic leagues: “Matchweek”
  - (Leave cups for later)
- Use the same MatchRow rendering we already have (score alignment + status pill + scheduled date/time centred under pill).
- Do not break existing Cups behaviour.

BACKEND CHANGES
1) Create a shared helper to compute “rounds” from matches:
   - Input: array of matches (with date/time, status, round/matchday label)
   - Output: rounds[] sorted ascending, where each round has:
     { key: string, index: number, label: string, startDate?: string, endDate?: string, matchesCount: number, hasAnyMatches: boolean }
   - Determine round key from existing fields used today for Europe (matchday/stage/round). Reuse the same parsing logic you used for UCL matchdays.
   - startDate/endDate should be min/max of match kick-off times for that round (if available).
   - hasAnyMatches true if matchesCount > 0.

2) Europe endpoint:
   - Update GET /api/europe/:slug to return:
     {
       competition, season,
       standings,
       rounds,               // computed
       matchesByRound: { [roundKey]: Match[] },
       latestRoundKey        // computed as last round with matchesCount>0, else last round
       knockout (existing)
     }
   - Ensure matchesByRound includes league-phase MD1..MD8 and knockout buckets if present (PO, L16, QF, SF, Final) using existing logic.
   - IMPORTANT: Some matches may have null scores. Avoid runtime errors (no non-null assertions like match.score!.home). Always guard score objects.

3) League (domestic) tables endpoint:
   - Extend the existing league tables endpoint used by Tables > Leagues (whatever route currently powers standings) to also return:
     rounds, matchesByRound, latestRoundKey
   - If the league tables endpoint currently only returns standings:
     - Fetch that league’s fixtures/results feed for the season (same provider/Goalserve source you already use elsewhere).
     - Group into rounds (matchweek) using the round label field available in the feed.
   - Keep the existing response fields intact; only add new fields.

FRONTEND CHANGES
4) Create a reusable component:
   - File: client/src/components/shared/round-toggle.tsx
   - Props:
     - labelType: "Matchday" | "Matchweek"
     - rounds: Array<{ key,label,startDate?,endDate?,matchesCount }>
     - value: string
     - onChange: (key: string) => void
   - UI:
     - Row with left chevron button, centered label (“Matchday 8” / “Matchweek 23”), right chevron button
     - Under the centered label, show date range if start/end exist (e.g. “28 Jan – 29 Jan”). If same day, show single date.
     - Disable prev/next at ends.
     - Keep it compact and consistent with the app styling.

5) Update EuropeProgress:
   - Replace the MD button grid entirely with RoundToggle.
   - Use rounds + latestRoundKey from API.
   - Default selection:
     - If URL query param exists (e.g. ?round=MD8) use it if valid
     - else default to latestRoundKey
   - When selection changes, update URL query param (shallow) and render matches from matchesByRound[selectedKey].
   - Keep the “Fixtures” header card.
   - Ensure the fixtures list renders ALL matches without internal scrolling.
   - Keep scheduled pill centred above date/time (vertical stack aligned center/right block like it was before). For FT/LIVE results, keep the new right-aligned score column close to the status pill.

6) Update Tables > Leagues layout to mirror the Champions League page:
   - Desktop (lg+):
     - Two-column grid: Standings left, Fixtures right.
     - Fixtures right has the RoundToggle at top, then the Matchday/Matchweek fixture list card below (same as Europe).
   - Mobile:
     - Keep the existing trimmed league table UI (Pos/Team/Pts with expandable row details).
     - Under the table, render the fixtures section:
       - RoundToggle
       - Match list for selected round
   - LabelType for leagues = “Matchweek”.

7) Default selection logic (shared):
   - Implement a helper on FE:
     - pickDefaultRound(rounds, latestRoundKey) => latestRoundKey if present/valid else last round key else first.
   - Use it for both Europe and Leagues.

TESTING / QA
8) Manual test checklist:
   - Europe > Champions League:
     - Lands on latestRoundKey by default (MD8 in current season)
     - Prev/next navigates correctly
     - Scheduled matches show pill centered above “28 Jan 20:00” (or whatever time) aligned right block
     - Finished matches show score right aligned near status pill
   - Tables > Leagues:
     - Mobile view shows trimmed table + expandable details like Premier League already does
     - Fixtures section shows Matchweek toggle + fixtures list
   - No runtime errors when score is null.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
- Reuse the existing MatchRow rendering logic from europe-progress where possible; refactor into a shared MatchRow component if it helps, but avoid large rewrites.
- Make the smallest, safest changes necessary.

DELIVERABLES
- Working RoundToggle component
- EuropeProgress uses RoundToggle
- League Tables page uses RoundToggle + fixtures sidebar on desktop, fixtures section on mobile
- Backend returns rounds + matchesByRound + latestRoundKey for Europe and Leagues
- No regressions to Cups
