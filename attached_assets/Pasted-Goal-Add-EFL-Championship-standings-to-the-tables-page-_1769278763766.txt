Goal: Add EFL Championship standings to the /tables page using the existing standings pipeline (GET /api/standings + autoRefresh=1 + polling). Do NOT add any “video testing” loops. Keep changes minimal and targeted.

Context:
- Premier League standings already work via /api/standings?leagueId=1204&season=YYYY/YYYY and client polling.
- There is a league id mapping helper in client/src/lib/league-config.ts.
- The /tables page uses the selected competition slug + season to build the standings request.

Tasks:

1) Add Championship mapping
- Update client/src/lib/league-config.ts to include Championship.
- Find the competition slug used for Championship in the Tables UI (likely "championship" or similar).
- Map that slug to Goalserve leagueId for Championship.
- If you are unsure of the correct Goalserve leagueId, add the mapping but also add a short developer note comment explaining it must match Goalserve.

2) Ensure /tables requests the correct leagueId for Championship
- When the user clicks the “Championship” tab, the network request to /api/standings must include the Championship leagueId and season normalized to “YYYY/YYYY”.
- Confirm the request URL includes autoRefresh=1.

3) Add a lightweight “dev verify” note (NO automated test loops)
- Add a short comment in docs/BUILD_LOG.md describing how to verify Championship:
  - Go to /tables → Championship → confirm request URL includes correct leagueId and season=YYYY%2FYYYY
  - Optional: trigger ingestion manually via the existing job endpoint with x-sync-secret
- Do not run any autoplay test recordings.

4) Manual ingestion (optional but helpful)
- If there is already a way to ingest standings for a league via /api/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings?leagueId=..., confirm it works for Championship too (no code changes needed if it’s generic).
- Do NOT hardcode secrets anywhere.

Acceptance criteria:
- Clicking Championship shows a populated standings table (or a graceful “No standings data” card if Goalserve has no snapshot yet).
- No UI regressions on Premier League.
- No automated test loop / video generation.

Please implement the changes now.
