TASK: Fix Premier League teams list + future-proof it using FPL bootstrap teams as source of truth (NO schema migration)

Schema context:
- teams table fields we can use:
  - name (unique)
  - slug (unique)
  - shortName
  - league (default "Premier League")
  - primaryColor, secondaryColor, logoUrl, stadiumName, founded, manager
- There is no isActive / competition flag; use `league` to decide which teams are in PL.

Goal:
- Teams page currently shows Ipswich/Leicester/Southampton as PL.
- Current PL should include Burnley/Leeds United/Sunderland instead.
- We already use https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/ (FPL bootstrap) for availability syncing.
- Make the PL membership auto-update by syncing teams from FPL bootstrap.

Deliverables (do in this order):

1) Update FPL team slug mapping
File: server/fpl-sync.ts
- Extend FPL_TEAM_SLUG_MAP with:
  - "Burnley": "burnley"
  - "Leeds": "leeds-united"
  - "Leeds United": "leeds-united"
  - "Sunderland": "sunderland"
- Keep existing mappings intact.

2) Implement syncFplTeams()
File: server/fpl-sync.ts (or new file server/fpl-teams-sync.ts, but export it)
- Create function: export async function syncFplTeams(): Promise<{ upserted: number; demoted: number; errors: string[] }>
- Fetch FPL_BOOTSTRAP_URL and read data.teams (array of {id, name, short_name})
- For each FPL team:
  - Derive slug using existing mapFplTeamToSlug(fplTeam.name, fplTeam.short_name)
  - Upsert into DB table "teams" using slug as the primary conflict target:
    - slug: derived slug
    - name: fplTeam.name (use FPL name unless we already have a name set for that slug; if a row exists, keep existing name unless it’s blank)
    - shortName: fplTeam.short_name
    - league: "Premier League"
    - Do NOT overwrite branding fields (primaryColor, secondaryColor, logoUrl, stadiumName, founded, manager) if already set in DB.
      - Only set those fields if currently NULL / empty.
- After processing all 20 FPL teams:
  - Identify teams in our DB that have league="Premier League" BUT slug NOT IN the current FPL slug list
  - Demote them by setting league="Championship"
  - Do not delete any teams.

Implementation notes:
- Use drizzle-orm upsert pattern similar to fplPlayerAvailability:
  - insert(teams).values(...).onConflictDoUpdate({ target: teams.slug, set: {...} })
- Since teams.name is also unique, ensure we don’t cause name collisions:
  - Prefer upsert by slug; if inserting a brand-new row and the name already exists on another row, handle gracefully:
    - In that case, keep the existing row’s name and set the new row name to `${fplTeam.name} FC` OR skip and log error.
  - Add errors[] entries rather than crashing sync.

3) Add secured endpoint to trigger team sync
File: server/routes.ts
- Add POST /api/jobs/sync-fpl-teams
- Require a secret:
  - Read expected secret from process.env.FPL_SYNC_SECRET (same env var used by availability sync if present)
  - Validate request header: x-sync-secret must equal expected secret
  - If missing/incorrect: return 401
- Handler should call syncFplTeams() and return JSON with { upserted, demoted, errors }

4) Ensure availability sync calls team sync first (so slugs/leagues stay correct)
- In the existing POST /api/jobs/sync-fpl-availability handler:
  - Call await syncFplTeams() before await syncFplAvailability()
  - Return both results (teams + availability) in the response payload.

5) Update Teams page filtering logic to use teams.league
File: client Teams page (where PL dropdown/filter is implemented)
- Ensure the Premier League view shows teams where team.league === "Premier League"
- Add a secondary option (if it exists) for Championship teams using team.league === "Championship"
- After running sync-fpl-teams, PL list must be 20 teams from FPL bootstrap.

6) One-time safety net: seed data update (until sync runs)
File: server/seed.ts (or wherever you seed teams)
- Update seeded Premier League teams to include:
  Arsenal, Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion, Burnley,
  Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham, Leeds United, Liverpool,
  Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest,
  Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, Wolverhampton Wanderers
- Remove: Ipswich Town, Leicester City, Southampton from the seeded PL set (they can remain seeded but set league="Championship")
- Slugs must match:
  burnley, leeds-united, sunderland
- Fulham slug must remain "fulham" (do not use “cottagers” anywhere)

7) Verification output
After sync, log:
- Number of DB rows with league="Premier League" (should be 20)
- List the 20 {name, slug}
- List demoted teams {name, slug}

Acceptance Criteria:
- Teams page no longer shows Ipswich/Leicester/Southampton under Premier League.
- Teams page shows Burnley/Leeds United/Sunderland under Premier League.
- Running POST /api/jobs/sync-fpl-teams with x-sync-secret updates PL membership without code changes.
- No deletions; demoted teams remain in DB with league="Championship".
