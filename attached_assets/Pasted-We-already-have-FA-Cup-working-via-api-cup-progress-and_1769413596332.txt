We already have FA Cup working via /api/cup/progress and the Cups UI accordion on /tables.
Now add the EFL Cup (Carabao Cup) using Goalserve competitionId=1199.

GOALS:
1) Add EFL Cup as an additional Cup tab/option next to FA Cup on the Tables page (Cups section).
   - Display name in UI: "EFL Cup" (optionally subtitle "Carabao Cup" in small text if you want, but keep it simple).
   - competitionId for API calls: 1199
   - season default: 2025/2026

2) Update the backend round canonicalization used inside /api/cup/progress so it supports BOTH:
   - FA Cup (1198) canonical 14-round naming (already implemented)
   - EFL Cup (1199) canonical 7-round naming:
     First Round
     Second Round
     Third Round
     Fourth Round
     Quarter-finals
     Semi-finals
     Final

3) IMPORTANT: keep FA Cup behaviour unchanged.
   - Only extend logic to support EFL Cup.
   - Reuse the existing endpoint shape:
     { competitionId, rounds: [{ name, order, matches: [...] }] }

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- In server/routes.ts (or wherever /api/cup/progress is implemented):
  a) Detect competitionId:
     const competitionId = String(req.query.competitionId || "")
  b) Use a competition-specific normalizer:
     - normalizeToCanonicalRound_FA_CUP(name) -> existing
     - normalizeToCanonicalRound_EFL_CUP(name) -> new
  c) For EFL Cup mapping, handle Goalserve round/stage names likely to appear, case-insensitively, e.g.:
     "First Round", "1st Round", "Round 1" => "First Round"
     "Second Round", "2nd Round", "Round 2" => "Second Round"
     "Third Round", "3rd Round", "Round 3" => "Third Round"
     "Fourth Round", "4th Round", "Round 4" => "Fourth Round"
     "Quarter-finals", "Quarterfinals", "Quarter Finals", "QF" => "Quarter-finals"
     "Semi-finals", "Semifinals", "Semi Finals", "SF" => "Semi-finals"
     "Final" => "Final"
  d) Assign stable ordering for EFL Cup:
     First Round = 1
     Second Round = 2
     Third Round = 3
     Fourth Round = 4
     Quarter-finals = 5
     Semi-finals = 6
     Final = 7

- Ensure deduping remains (by match id) and that we do NOT double-parse stage.match and stage.round[].match duplicates.
- Keep the HTML-detection guard and season parameter support.

FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- In client/src/components/tables/cup-progress.tsx (or current Cups component):
  a) Add a selector / tabs to switch between cups:
     - FA Cup (competitionId=1198)
     - EFL Cup (competitionId=1199)
  b) When selected, call /api/cup/progress?competitionId=...&season=2025/2026
  c) Keep the accordion UI behaviour: each round collapsible; show all fixtures per round when expanded.
  d) The API now returns display-ready canonical names, so don’t over-format beyond existing.

DOCS:
- Update replit.md:
  - Add EFL Cup support summary (id 1199)
  - Add EFL Cup canonical round list + ordering table.

VALIDATION:
- Add (or update) quick shell verification commands in replit.md:
  export DOMAIN=...
  curl -sS "$DOMAIN/api/cup/progress?competitionId=1199&season=2025/2026" > /tmp/eflcup.json
  node -e 'const d=require("/tmp/eflcup.json"); console.log("Rounds:", d.rounds.length); d.rounds.forEach(r=>console.log(r.order, r.name, r.matches.length));'

- Make sure /tables shows both cups and switching works.

Please implement all changes and keep them minimal and robust.
