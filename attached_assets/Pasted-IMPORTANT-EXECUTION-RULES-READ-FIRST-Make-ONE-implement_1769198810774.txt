IMPORTANT EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- Make ONE implementation pass only.
- DO NOT run automated tests.
- DO NOT re-test, re-run, or iterate.
- DO NOT refactor unrelated code.
- DO NOT “double-check”, “validate again”, or loop.
- After changes compile, STOP.

You are working in the Football Mad frontend (Vite + React).
Frontend UI/layout changes ONLY. No backend changes.

--------------------------------------------------
GOALS
--------------------------------------------------

1) MOBILE LAYOUT — STACKED CONTROLS
On mobile ONLY:
- Controls must be stacked vertically in this order:
  1. Date navigation row (already correct)
  2. Filter dropdown (full width)
  3. Sort dropdown (full width, BELOW filter)

On desktop:
- Keep current layout (Filter + Sort inline to the right of date picker).

Implementation note:
- Use responsive utility classes only (e.g. Tailwind breakpoints).
- Do NOT duplicate components.

--------------------------------------------------

2) REMOVE “(Country)” TEXT EVERYWHERE
- Remove country names in brackets from ALL competition labels.
- This includes:
  - Match cards
  - Filter dropdown options
  - Selected filter labels

Rules:
- Country identification must rely ONLY on the flag pill.
- Keep competitions separated by competitionId (already implemented).
- DO NOT add new text-based disambiguation.
- If two leagues share the same name, the flag alone is sufficient.

--------------------------------------------------

3) CENTER COMPETITION PILL ABOVE KICKOFF TIME
- In match cards:
  - Center the competition pill (flag + league name)
  - Position it ABOVE the kickoff time
  - Align centrally with the time column

- Team layout stays unchanged.
- Applies to both mobile and desktop.

--------------------------------------------------
CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------

- No new libraries.
- No backend changes.
- No new state management.
- Keep existing filtering, sorting, grouping logic.
- Keep dropdown placeholders:
  - “Filter by…”
  - “Sort by…”

--------------------------------------------------
LIKELY FILES
--------------------------------------------------

- Matches page layout:
  client/src/pages/matches.tsx

- Match card UI:
  client/src/components/EnhancedMatchCard.tsx (or similar)

- Filter dropdown option rendering:
  Matches page or related component

--------------------------------------------------
STOP CONDITION
--------------------------------------------------

Once:
- UI compiles
- Layout matches screenshots
- No “(Country)” text appears
→ STOP immediately and report changes made.

Do NOT continue testing.
