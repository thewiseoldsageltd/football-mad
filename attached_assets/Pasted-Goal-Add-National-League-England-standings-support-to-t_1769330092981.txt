Goal: Add National League (England) standings support to the Tables page, including correct promotion/playoff/relegation zone highlighting as per Soccerway:
- 1st: Promoted
- 2nd–3rd: Playoff Semi-final
- 4th–7th: Playoff Quarter-final
- 21st–24th: Relegation (bottom 4)

Also: Add a small dev-only endpoint to preview Goalserve standings metadata (league name/country/season/team count) for a given goalserve leagueId, so we can confirm the correct leagueId before we ingest.

Changes:

1) client/src/lib/league-config.ts
- Add a new league config entry:
  slug: "national-league"
  name: "National League"
  (goalserveLeagueId: leave as a placeholder string for now e.g. "TODO_GOALSERVE_ID")
- Add standingsZones for National League:
  - { label: "Promoted", range: [1,1], color: "emerald" }
  - { label: "Playoff Semi-final", range: [2,3], color: "amber" }
  - { label: "Playoff Quarter-final", range: [4,7], color: "orange" }
  - { label: "Relegation", range: [21,24], color: "red" }

Make sure the zones system supports multiple different colours (we already use emerald/amber/red — add orange if not present, using Tailwind classes).

2) client/src/data/tables-mock.ts (or wherever the Tables league tabs are defined)
- Add "National League" as a selectable tab in the Leagues list, using id/slug: "national-league".
- Ensure it flows through the existing tables page logic the same way as PL/Championship/League One/League Two.

3) server/routes.ts
Add a DEV utility route to preview goalserve standings without ingesting:
GET /api/dev/goalserve/standings-preview?leagueId=XXXX
- Must require x-sync-secret header and reuse GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET to protect it.
- It should call Goalserve standings feed for that leagueId using the existing GOALSERVE_FEED_KEY env var.
- Parse enough to return:
  { ok: true, leagueId, country, leagueName, season, stageId, teamCount }
- If the response doesn’t look like standings data, return ok:false and include the raw top-level keys.

Important: Keep this endpoint lightweight and safe (no DB writes). It is for development only.

4) After wiring, update docs/BUILD_LOG.md with:
- The National League zone rules
- The new preview endpoint usage

Acceptance checks:
- National League appears in /tables.
- Zones render with the correct ranges and legend labels.
- Preview endpoint works and helps us find the correct goalserve leagueId.
