You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Next.js + Tailwind). Update the Matches page UI (desktop + mobile) with small, high-impact UX improvements, keeping the existing design system and layout.

GOALS (do all):
1) Section header clarity
- Wherever the page currently renders a group label like “Today”, “Tomorrow”, “This Week”, “Results”, update the heading to include a short date context.
  Examples:
  - “Today — Thu 15 Jan”
  - “Tomorrow — Fri 16 Jan”
  - For “This Week”, render the range: “This Week — Mon 12 Jan – Sun 18 Jan”
- Use the user’s locale for formatting (en-GB). Keep typography consistent with existing H2/H3 styles.

2) Make score/time the visual hero (desktop + mobile)
- In match cards, slightly increase emphasis of the central value:
  - If the match is LIVE/FT: the score “2 – 1” should be visually stronger (font-semibold).
  - If not started: the kick-off time “15:00” should be visually stronger (font-semibold).
- Reduce the visual weight of the meta row (date + venue) slightly (e.g., text-sm / text-muted-foreground), without removing it.

3) LIVE urgency cue (subtle)
- For LIVE matches only:
  - Add a thin left accent border on the match card using the existing red (e.g., border-l-4 border-red-500).
  - Keep the current LIVE lozenge/badge as-is.
  - Do NOT add heavy animations; no pulsing required.

4) Cards should feel tappable (even if routes aren’t built yet)
- Entire match card should have:
  - cursor-pointer on desktop
  - subtle hover state on desktop (slight shadow increase or bg tint)
  - subtle active/pressed state on mobile (bg tint)
- Ensure accessibility: add focus-visible ring for keyboard navigation.
- If the card is wrapped in a Link already, apply these states to the clickable container.

5) Filters: desktop alignment + mobile usability
- Desktop:
  - Keep filters on the same row as sub-navigation (already close). Ensure spacing is consistent and right-aligned. No layout shifts.
- Mobile:
  - Keep filters stacked full-width as currently shown.
  - Ensure the “Search team…” input does NOT autofocus on page load (avoid keyboard popping).
  - If there is any autofocus attribute or autoFocus prop on mobile, remove it.

6) Empty states (future-proof for Goalserve)
- Add an empty state component for each tab when there are no matches:
  - Message: “No matches scheduled.”
  - Secondary: “Try Tomorrow or Results.”
- Keep it lightweight and consistent with existing empty states (centered text, muted).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change the current overall information architecture (tabs stay: Today, Tomorrow, This Week, Results).
- Do not remove any existing filters; just refine behaviour and styling.
- Keep Tailwind classes consistent with the rest of the project.
- No new dependencies.
- Ensure everything looks good on both desktop and mobile.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement changes in the Matches page and any shared MatchCard component used by it.
- Ensure TypeScript passes and the page renders with dummy data as before.
