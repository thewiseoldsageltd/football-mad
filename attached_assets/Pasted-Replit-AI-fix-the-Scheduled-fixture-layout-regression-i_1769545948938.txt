Replit AI — fix the “Scheduled” fixture layout regression in Champions League fixtures list (Tables > Europe > Champions League) WITHOUT changing the new score alignment for completed matches.

Issue:
- For upcoming fixtures (latest matchday), we used to render:
  - A “Scheduled” (or “Not Started”) pill on the RIGHT
  - And directly UNDER it (same right alignment), the date + kick-off time
  - The pill + date/time were vertically stacked and visually centred as a unit.
- After the score alignment changes, the date/time block is no longer appearing in that stacked right-aligned position (and may be missing/misaligned).

Goal:
- Restore the previous upcoming-fixture right column layout:
  - Right column = a vertical stack aligned right:
    1) Status pill (Scheduled/Not Started/Upcoming)
    2) Date + KO time (e.g. “16 Sep 19:00”) underneath
  - Both items aligned to the right edge, and the date/time centred under the pill (as before).

Constraints:
- Keep the new scoreline alignment for finished matches (scores right-aligned near the Full-Time/AET pill).
- Only affect fixtures that are NOT finished (i.e. scheduled / not started / in future).
- No backend changes.

Where:
- client/src/components/tables/europe-progress.tsx
  - Find the fixture row renderer (MatchRow or equivalent) used in the right-hand “Fixtures” list.

Implementation detail:
1) Detect “upcoming” fixtures (no final score to show) using the same conditions already used to decide displayScore:
   - If match.status is Scheduled/Not Started/Upcoming (or if displayScore is false), treat as upcoming.
2) For upcoming fixtures, render the right side as:
   - <div className="flex flex-col items-end gap-1 text-right">
       <StatusPill ... />
       <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
         {formattedDateTime}
       </div>
     </div>
   - Ensure formattedDateTime uses the same formatter function as before (don’t change formatting).
3) For finished fixtures, keep the current right side layout that includes:
   - score column (right aligned) and the status pill (Full-Time/AET etc).

Acceptance:
- Upcoming matchday fixtures show NO scores.
- Upcoming fixtures show pill + date/time stacked on right, date/time underneath pill.
- Finished fixtures remain unchanged with the new score alignment.
