TASK: News polish – remove redundant chips, fix mobile filter drawer keyboard behaviour, and switch to live filtering

ISSUES TO FIX:
1) On News list page, a “Breaking” chip/lozenge still renders under the sub-navigation. Remove this UI element for now.
2) On News cards, internal chips like “Pick”, “Trending”, “analysis”, “news”, “transfers” still appear. For News cards, only show pills derived from PA tag matching:
   - Competition pill
   - Team pill
   - Player pill
   Max 3 pills per card (priority: Competition → Team → Player)
   Hide all other internal category chips on News cards.
3) Mobile filter drawer UX issue: opening the drawer triggers keyboard automatically, collapsing the teams list and making scrolling difficult.
4) Filter application UX: remove the “Show X articles” confirmation button and apply filters live as the user selects options.

CHANGES – NEWS LIST PAGE:
- Remove the “Breaking” filter chip/lozenge that appears under the sub-navigation.
- Ensure the News list UI relies on: sub-navigation (competition) + filter drawer (team/player).

CHANGES – NEWS CARD PILLS:
- Only show up to 3 pills on News cards.
- Pills must come from matched entities/tags:
  1) competition
  2) team
  3) player
- Hide any other chips/labels on cards (Pick, Trending, analysis, news, transfers, etc.)
- Keep full pills list visible on the article page only.

CHANGES – MOBILE FILTER DRAWER (KEYBOARD FIX):
- Remove any autoFocus behaviour for the team search input (do not focus on drawer open).
- Do not programmatically focus any input when the drawer opens.
- Keyboard should only appear when the user taps the search field.
- Keep drawer as ONE single scroll container (no nested scroll areas).
- The teams list should remain scrollable via the drawer’s main scroll even when keyboard is open.

CHANGES – LIVE FILTERING:
- Remove the “Show X articles” button from the drawer.
- Apply filtering immediately when:
  - competition changes (from drawer competition selector or sub-nav)
  - team checkbox selection changes
  - player search selection changes (if implemented)
- Keep a “Clear filters” action (simple text button) to reset team/player filters.
- Close (X) closes drawer; no confirmation needed.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not redesign styling; change behaviour and visibility only.
- Maintain null-safe rendering.
- Keep the competition selector in the drawer footer (or lower section), but update teams list based on the selected competition.
- Ensure no regressions to Injuries filter drawer behaviour.

ACCEPTANCE:
- No “Breaking” chip below sub-nav on News.
- News cards only show Competition/Team/Player pills (max 3).
- Opening mobile filter drawer does NOT open the keyboard automatically.
- No “Show X articles” button; filters apply live and results update immediately.
