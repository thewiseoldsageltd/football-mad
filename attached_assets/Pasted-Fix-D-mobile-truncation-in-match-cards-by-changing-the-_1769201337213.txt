Fix D) mobile truncation in match cards by changing the small-screen layout to a true 3-column grid: [home | kickoff | away], with home/away names hugging the kickoff time (towards centre), not the outer edges.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change data fetching, sorting, grouping, or backend.
- Do NOT rework desktop layout unless needed; scope changes to mobile (base) with `sm:`/`md:` overrides.
- No long test loops: make changes, run typecheck once, quick manual visual check only.

WHAT TO CHANGE
1) Find the match card component used in /matches list (likely `client/src/components/EnhancedMatchCard.tsx`).
   Locate the section that renders:
   - home crest + home name (left)
   - kickoff time (centre)
   - away name + away crest (right)

2) On MOBILE (base classes), implement this structure:
   - Wrap the “main row” in:
     `grid grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr] items-center gap-3`
   - HOME column (left):
     `min-w-0 flex items-center justify-end gap-2`
     (IMPORTANT: justify-end makes the name hug the centre)
     Inside it:
       crest (fixed size)
       name with `min-w-0 truncate text-left` (or text-right if you prefer, but must truncate correctly)
   - KICKOFF column (middle):
     `flex flex-col items-center justify-center`
     include the competition pill above time if currently there, but ensure it does NOT affect the row’s width:
       - pill should be centered and `max-w-full`
       - time stays centered
   - AWAY column (right):
     `min-w-0 flex items-center justify-start gap-2`
     Inside it:
       name with `min-w-0 truncate text-right` (or text-left, but truncate correctly)
       crest (fixed size)

3) Ensure NO OVERFLOW / BLEED:
   - Apply `min-w-0` to both home and away containers AND the name span.
   - Names must use `truncate overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap`.
   - Crests must be fixed: e.g. `shrink-0 w-10 h-10` (whatever you currently use).

4) Keep DESKTOP behaviour as-is:
   - Use `sm:` or `md:` to restore the existing desktop flex layout if needed.
   Example pattern:
   - Mobile: grid (as above)
   - `sm:flex sm:items-center sm:justify-between` for your current desktop row

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (manual, quick):
- On mobile, Derby and West Brom should display far less truncation (ideally full on common names).
- Home/away names should visually “hug” the centre time.
- No horizontal scrolling; away team must not bleed off-screen.

After implementation:
- run `npm run typecheck` (or repo equivalent) once.
- reply with the exact file(s) changed and what classes/structure you used.
