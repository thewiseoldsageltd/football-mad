You are working inside the Football Mad codebase (frontend + backend) that currently supports “Tables > Cups” with Goalserve soccerfixtures feeds and round normalizers.

We are now implementing the “Tables > Europe” tab for:
- Champions League (UCL)
- Europa League (UEL)
- Conference League (UECL)

IMPORTANT: Do this ONE competition at a time. Start with Champions League only.
Also IMPORTANT: UCL uses the NEW FORMAT (league phase), so the frontend UI must change vs the old group-stage layout.

Use Goalserve feeds. Prefer JSON output by adding ?json=1 where supported.

Reference endpoints patterns:
- Mapping list: /soccerfixtures/data/mapping
- Fixtures by league: /soccerfixtures/leagueid/{ID}
- Standings: /standings/{leagueId}.xml (if json is supported, use ?json=1; if not, parse XML server-side)
(These are consistent with the provided Goalserve endpoints sheet.)

PHASE 1 (Backend) — Champions League support
1) Add competition IDs:
   - Locate UCL / UEL / UECL IDs using the mapping feed and store them in config. (Do NOT hardcode guesses; fetch mapping and search for “Champions League”, “Europa League”, “Europa Conference League”.)
   - Add these IDs to the backend competition registry similarly to cups.

2) Create a Europe API endpoint:
   - New route: GET /api/europe/:slug?season=YYYY%2FYYYY (or same season selector format used by cups)
   - Response should include:
     {
       competition: { slug, name, country: "Europe", goalserveCompetitionId },
       season: "2025/2026",
       phases: [
         {
           type: "league_phase",
           name: "League Phase",
           standings: [...],
           matchdays: [
             { matchday: 1, matches: [...] },
             ...
           ]
         },
         {
           type: "knockout",
           rounds: [
             { name: "Knockout Play-offs", matches: [...] },
             { name: "Round of 16", matches: [...] },
             { name: "Quarter-finals", matches: [...] },
             { name: "Semi-finals", matches: [...] },
             { name: "Final", matches: [...] }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }

3) Parsing rules (UCL):
   - UCL “League Phase”:
     - Standings: fetch from Goalserve standings endpoint for that competition ID.
     - Fixtures: from soccerfixtures/leagueid/{ID}; group by matchday (often “Round”, “Matchday”, or “stage/round” attributes — inspect the feed and implement robust parsing).
   - Knockout:
     - Detect and group by stage names from Goalserve (“Knockout Round Play-offs”, “Round of 16”, etc. — implement a mapping table if Goalserve labels differ).
   - Reuse existing match parsing logic (score, ft_score/et_score/pen_score, status chips like FT/AET/Penalties) — this must work exactly like cups.

4) Sanity guards:
   - Avoid duplicate matches across phases.
   - Sort matchdays numerically; sort matches by date/time.
   - If standings are missing, still return fixtures (and vice-versa), but include empty arrays.
   - Log useful debug info for stage/round label discovery (only in dev).

PHASE 2 (Frontend) — New Europe UI (UCL only)
1) Add “Europe” tab next to “Leagues” and “Cups” in Tables page.
2) Under “Europe” show sub-tabs:
   - Champions League (only for now; keep config ready for UEL/UECL later but hidden behind a feature flag or TODO)
3) UCL page layout:
   - Section A: “League Phase”
     - Left/Top: Standings table (rank, team, played, W/D/L, GF, GA, GD, points)
     - Right/Below: Matchday selector (Matchday 1..N) + list of matches for selected matchday
   - Section B: “Knockout”
     - Simple MVP: collapsible round cards (like cups) for each knockout round, listing matches
     - (Do NOT attempt a full bracket visual yet; just clean round cards)

4) UX requirements:
   - Must be responsive (mobile friendly): standings scrolls horizontally if needed.
   - Match lists reuse existing match row UI (home/away, score, penalty brackets).
   - Keep the existing season dropdown working.

PHASE 3 (Follow-ups AFTER UCL works)
- Add Europa League and Conference League using the same Europe UI and backend structures.
- If their formats mirror the league-phase system, reuse; otherwise adjust.

DELIVERABLES
- Code changes in backend + frontend.
- Update docs (BUILD_LOG.md / DECISIONS.md / PROMPTS.md) with:
  - competition IDs discovered
  - parsing assumptions about labels (matchday/stage)
  - any mapping tables added
- Provide a quick checklist for manual testing:
  - League phase standings render
  - Matchday switching works
  - Knockout rounds show when present
  - Penalties/AET chips still correct

START NOW:
- Step 1: Identify the UCL ID from mapping feed and add it to config.
- Step 2: Build backend endpoint returning league_phase + knockout structure.
- Step 3: Build frontend Europe tab and UCL layout.

Do not change existing Cups behavior.
