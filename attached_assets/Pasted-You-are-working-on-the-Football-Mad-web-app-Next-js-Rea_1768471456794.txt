You are working on the Football Mad web app (Next.js + React + Tailwind). 
Update the NEWS ARTICLE PAGE template to match the new “clean article stack” design and rules below.

GOAL
Implement a clean article page where editorial/state pills (Breaking, Editor’s Pick, Trending, Analysis) never appear. 
Instead, show PA Media entity tags (Competition, Team(s), Player(s)) as pills in the header area above the hero image.

PAGES AFFECTED
- Article detail page (e.g. /news/[slug] or equivalent route)
- Reusable components used by the article page (TagPills, ArticleHeader, etc.)

DESIGN RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
1) REMOVE editorial/state pills from article page entirely:
   - Do NOT render: Breaking, Editor’s Pick, Trending, Analysis (or any editorial badges).
   - These can remain on card/feed views if they exist there, but never on the article page.

2) ARTICLE HEADER STACK (top to bottom):
   A) Back link row: “← Back to News”
   B) Entity pills row (PA Media tags):
      - Competition pill (e.g., Premier League)
      - Team pill(s) (e.g., Chelsea, Arsenal)
      - Player pill(s) (e.g., Cole Palmer)
      - Show ALL entity pills on the article page (no 3-pill limit here)
   C) H1 headline
   D) Standfirst/summary
   E) Meta row: author/source name, published time (relative), read time, views
   F) Bookmark/save icon aligned right of the meta row (keep if already implemented)
   G) Hero image block
   H) Article body content

3) Entity pills styling:
   - Use the site’s existing pill/chip style (rounded, subtle border, light background).
   - Make Competition pill visually distinct but still subtle (e.g., trophy icon + grey chip).
   - Team pills should use team accent color if available, otherwise a neutral outline.
   - Player pills neutral outline.
   - Pills must wrap nicely on mobile.
   - Pills should be clickable (if routes exist):
       * Competition -> /news?competition=<id or slug>
       * Team -> /teams/<teamSlug> or /news?team=<id>
       * Player -> /players/<playerSlug> or /news?player=<id>
     If those routes don’t exist yet, keep them as buttons/anchors with href="#" and TODO comment.

4) Data mapping (PA Media hierarchy):
   - Article data includes tags or metadata representing:
     * competition
     * teams (array)
     * players (array)
   - Normalize them into a single list for rendering in this order:
     competition first, then teams, then players.
   - Never include editorial labels in this list.

5) Card view vs Article view pill logic:
   - Card/feed components may still cap pills at 3.
   - Article page must NOT cap; show all entity pills.

6) Remove any “Breaking” lozenge that appears below the sub-navigation on News pages if that is still present in the shared News layout component.
   - The News listing page should not have an extra standalone “Breaking” pill row under the sub-nav.
   - Only render sub-nav + inline filters per the Injuries pattern.

RESPONSIVE REQUIREMENTS
- Desktop: entity pills appear under “Back to News” and above headline OR directly above headline (choose the cleanest).
- Mobile: pills wrap and remain readable; keep spacing tight but not cramped.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- If the article page currently receives an array like `article.tags`, filter out any tags with types like:
   ["breaking","editors_pick","trending","analysis","pick"]
  (case-insensitive) on the ARTICLE PAGE only.
- Create/Update a component: <EntityPills competition teams players />
- Ensure no other part of the article page reintroduces editorial pills.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated article page component matching the stack above.
- EntityPills component (new or updated).
- Ensure the screenshot outcome matches: entity pills appear near the top (where editorial pills used to be), and the old editorial pills do not appear anywhere on article pages.

After implementation, run the app and verify:
- Article page shows competition/team/player pills near the top
- No analysis/breaking/editors pick/trending pills are shown on the article page
- Pills wrap on mobile
- News listing page doesn’t show a stray “Breaking” lozenge under the sub-nav
