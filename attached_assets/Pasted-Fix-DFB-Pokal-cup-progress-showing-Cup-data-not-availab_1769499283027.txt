Fix DFB-Pokal cup progress showing "Cup data not available" and implement correct round naming.

Goal:
- DFB-Pokal tab should show fixtures grouped by rounds.
- Use Soccerway-style round names (First Round, Second Round, Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Final).
- Goalserve feed for DFB Pokal is "Germany Cup" competitionId = 1226.

Steps:

1) client/src/lib/cup-config.ts
- Add/verify a config entry for DFB-Pokal:
  - slug: "dfb-pokal"
  - name: "DFB-Pokal"
  - shortName: "DFB"
  - country: "Germany"
  - goalserveCompetitionId: "1226"
- Ensure it is included in the Cups list used by the Tables page tabs (same as FA Cup / EFL Cup / Copa del Rey / Coppa Italia).

2) server/routes.ts
- Ensure the /api/cup/progress endpoint recognises competitionId 1226 as a supported cup.
  - Add an isDfbPokal flag (similar to isCoppaItalia / isCopaDelRey etc) OR include 1226 in the existing cup allow-list.
  - Make sure the handler does NOT return the "Cup data not available" response for 1226.

3) Round name normalisation for DFB-Pokal (1226)
Goalserve provides fraction labels for early rounds. Map them to user friendly names:
  - "1/32-finals" -> "First Round"
  - "1/16-finals" -> "Second Round"
  - "1/8-finals"  -> "Round of 16"
  - Preserve "Quarter-finals", "Semi-finals", "Final" (normalise minor variants: "Quarterfinals" -> "Quarter-finals", "Semifinals" -> "Semi-finals")
Implement:
  - DFB_POKAL_CANONICAL_ROUNDS order map:
      First Round: 1
      Second Round: 2
      Round of 16: 3
      Quarter-finals: 4
      Semi-finals: 5
      Final: 6
  - normalizeToCanonicalRound_DFB_POKAL(rawRoundName: string): string
  - Only apply this normaliser when competitionId === "1226" (don’t affect other competitions).

4) Round seeding / “show empty rounds”
- Ensure Semi-finals and Final appear even if Goalserve hasn’t populated matches yet (same approach as Coppa Italia):
  - Seed all canonical rounds in the response with an empty array if missing.

5) Validate
- Add a quick log or temporary debug output to confirm that the parsed stages/round names exist for 1226.
- Run:
  - curl /api/cup/progress?competitionId=1226
  - Confirm response contains 6 rounds with correct names and match counts (First Round 32, Second Round 16, Round of 16 8, Quarter-finals 4, and seeded empty for Semi-finals + Final if not yet available).

6) Frontend
- Confirm DFB-Pokal tab uses competitionId 1226 from cup-config.
- No special UI changes required beyond showing returned round titles.

Deliverable: commit the changes in the above files and confirm DFB-Pokal no longer shows "Cup data not available".
