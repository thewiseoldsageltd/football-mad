TASK: Treatment Room page – lock navigation + sorting logic + clean Team filter options

CONTEXT:
We have a Treatment Room page (global Injuries) powered by FPL data.
We already have sub-navigation tabs:
- Overview
- Returning (75%)
- Coin flip (50%)
- Doubtful (25%)
- Out (0%)

We also currently have a sort dropdown with options like “Most relevant”, “Last updated”, “Highest confidence”, “Lowest confidence”.
We also have a Team dropdown that currently contains duplicates and non-Prem teams.

GOALS:
1) Keep the sub-navigation tabs as the primary “state” selector.
2) Keep the sort dropdown, but make it purely “ordering” (not state).
3) Clean the Team dropdown so it only shows current Premier League clubs, with no duplicates or non-PL entries.

A) SORT DROPDOWN CHANGES (UI + logic)
- Rename sort option “Most relevant” to “Closest return”.
- Make “Closest return” the DEFAULT sort option on first load.
- Keep these sort options:
  1. Closest return (default)
  2. Last updated
  3. Highest confidence
  4. Lowest confidence

Sorting logic:
- For all tabs, sorting applies AFTER filtering by tab/team.
- “Closest return”:
   - Primary: earliest expected_return_date (ascending)
   - If expected_return_date is missing or “Unknown”/null, push to bottom
   - Secondary: higher chance_of_playing first (descending)
   - Tertiary: most recently updated (descending)
- “Last updated”: most recently updated first.
- “Highest confidence”: highest confidence first.
- “Lowest confidence”: lowest confidence first.
Notes:
- If confidence is missing, treat as null and push to bottom for highest-confidence sort, and push to top for lowest-confidence sort (or keep missing at bottom for both—pick one and be consistent; prefer missing at bottom for both to avoid weirdness).

B) TEAM DROPDOWN CLEANUP (dedupe + PL-only)
The Team filter should only show current Premier League clubs, one entry each, using this exact display format:
CODE – Short name

Allowlist the following only (and remove everything else, including Championship variants, long-name duplicates, and clubs not in the Premier League):
- ARS – Arsenal
- AVL – Aston Villa
- BOU – Bournemouth
- BRE – Brentford
- BHA – Brighton
- BUR – Burnley
- CHE – Chelsea
- CRY – Crystal Palace
- EVE – Everton
- FUL – Fulham
- LEE – Leeds
- LIV – Liverpool
- MCI – Man City
- MUN – Man Utd
- NEW – Newcastle
- NFO – Nottingham Forest
- SUN – Sunderland
- TOT – Tottenham
- WHU – West Ham
- WOL – Wolves

Implementation detail:
- Use a canonical team mapping layer. If the FPL feed returns multiple team name variants (e.g. “Brighton” vs “Brighton and Hove Albion”), map them to the canonical entry above.
- The dropdown must not show duplicates under any circumstance.

C) TAB LOGIC (state filtering)
Tab-to-state mapping:
- Returning tab: chance_of_playing == 75
- Coin flip tab: chance_of_playing == 50
- Doubtful tab: chance_of_playing == 25
- Out tab: chance_of_playing == 0
- Overview tab: includes ALL injury records (0/25/50/75). It should default-sort using “Closest return” so users see Returners first, then Coin flip, then Doubtful, then Out.

For Overview only, apply an additional “availability tier” ordering before the “Closest return” ordering:
Tier order: 75% first, then 50%, then 25%, then 0%.
Within each tier, apply the selected sort ordering.

D) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
✅ Default state on page load:
- Overview tab selected
- Sort dropdown = “Closest return”
- Cards show 75% players first (earliest return dates first), then 50%, then 25%, then 0%

✅ Sort dropdown does NOT duplicate the job of tabs.
It only changes ordering.

✅ Team dropdown:
- Contains ONLY the allowlist clubs above
- No “Bournemouth (Championship)”
- No “Brighton and Hove Albion”
- No duplicates like “Newcastle” + “Newcastle United”
- No removed clubs like Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton, etc.

✅ Changing Team filter + Tab filter + Sort works in combination:
Data is filtered by Team + Tab first, then sorted by selected sort.

Please implement this cleanly with small helper functions:
- normalizeTeam(teamNameOrCode) -> canonicalTeam
- getFilteredPlayers({tab, team}) -> list
- sortPlayers(list, sortMode, tab) -> list
