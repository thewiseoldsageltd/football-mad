TASK: Stadium sponsorship name overrides (Teams page + team hubs)

We’ve fixed Bournemouth display naming. Now we need to update 3 stadium names to their sponsorship/current names (and keep them stable even if Wikidata returns the old generic names).

REQUIRED STADIUM NAME OVERRIDES (by team slug)
- afc-bournemouth → "Vitality Stadium"   (was Dean Court)
- brentford → "Gtech Community Stadium"  (was Brentford Community Stadium)
- brighton-and-hove-albion → "American Express Stadium" (was Brighton Community Stadium)

WHAT TO DO
1) Add a stadium override map in the team metadata sync job (server job that currently pulls from Wikidata).
   - e.g. const STADIUM_NAME_OVERRIDES: Record<string, string> = { ... }
2) When syncing a team:
   - If an override exists for that teamSlug, set stadiumName to the override value.
   - This should apply even if the stadiumName field is already populated (overrides should win).
   - Manager logic can remain “only fill if empty” as currently implemented.
3) Also apply the overrides immediately to the database so the UI updates without needing to wait for the next sync:
   - Run a DB update (drizzle or SQL) to set stadium_name for those 3 teams (match by slug).
4) Ensure Teams page + Team Hub header cards use teams.stadiumName consistently (no hardcoded strings).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Bournemouth shows “Vitality Stadium”
- Brentford shows “Gtech Community Stadium”
- Brighton shows “American Express Stadium”
- Future runs of POST /api/jobs/sync-team-metadata do not revert these names.

FILES (likely)
- server/* team metadata sync job (where Wikidata fetch/merge happens)
- server/db.ts + drizzle schema already has teams.stadiumName
- Any query / UI component reading stadiumName should remain unchanged

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
If you need a one-off migration script, add something like:
- server/script/fix-stadium-overrides.ts
and wire it to run once, OR just run a direct update in the sync job immediately after computing overrides.

After changes, confirm by showing the three updated cards in Teams page screenshot.
