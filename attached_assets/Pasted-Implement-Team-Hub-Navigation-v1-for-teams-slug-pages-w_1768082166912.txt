Implement Team Hub Navigation v1 for /teams/:slug pages with URL-driven tabs, deep linking, and smooth UX.

Goals:

Tabs must be shareable URLs (deep links)

Navigation must feel instant (client-side), not page reload-y

Mobile-first: tabs scroll horizontally, remain usable on small screens

Preserve current team header + Follow/Subscribe CTAs and existing styling

1) URL structure (routes)

Support these routes (all must work):

/teams/:slug → default tab Latest

/teams/:slug/latest

/teams/:slug/injuries

/teams/:slug/transfers

/teams/:slug/matches

/teams/:slug/fans

The tabs must update the URL using client-side navigation (no full refresh).
Visiting any route directly must load the correct tab state.

2) Tabs UI + active state

Tabs should be rendered as a horizontal pill/tab row under the team header.

Active tab must be visually obvious using team-colour accent (underline or pill fill + icon emphasis).

Inactive tabs remain neutral.

Add subtle hover + active press micro-interactions (lift/opacity) consistent with the new visual energy pass.

3) Sticky tab bar (optional but recommended)

On scroll, make the tab bar sticky under the main site header (desktop + mobile), so users can switch sections without scrolling back up.
Ensure it does not overlap content and maintains spacing.

4) Content rendering per tab

Each tab should render as a distinct section component; no duplicated logic:

Latest: reuse the News feed logic filtered by teams=:slug (same article cards and sorting).

Injuries: team-scoped injuries list/table (existing injuries data).

Transfers: team-scoped transfer list (existing transfers data).

Matches: team-scoped fixtures/results list (existing matches data).

Fans: team-scoped community posts (or placeholder + empty state if not implemented yet).

Each tab must have a friendly empty state and should never crash if data is missing.

5) SEO + metadata

Set canonical URL to the tab route (/teams/:slug/<tab>)

Add sensible title formatting (e.g. “Arsenal Transfers | Football Mad”)

Ensure OpenGraph/Twitter card tags use team + tab context

6) Preserve context on tab change

When switching tabs, keep the user anchored near the tab/content area (no jump to top).
Optionally scroll to the tabs smoothly if needed.

7) Analytics hooks (lightweight)

Add basic tracking events for tab clicks (tab name + team slug) for future insights.

Acceptance Criteria:

Direct linking to /teams/arsenal/transfers loads the Arsenal page with Transfers tab active.

Switching tabs updates URL instantly and feels smooth.

Tabs are usable on mobile (horizontal scroll) and optionally sticky on scroll.

No duplicated article logic: Latest uses the existing News system filtered by team slug.

Empty states exist for each tab and are user-friendly.
