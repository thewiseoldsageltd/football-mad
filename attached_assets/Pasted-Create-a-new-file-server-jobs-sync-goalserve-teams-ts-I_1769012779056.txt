Create a new file: server/jobs/sync-goalserve-teams.ts

It must export:
export async function syncGoalserveTeams(leagueId: string): Promise<{
  ok: boolean;
  leagueId: string;
  goalserveTeams: number;
  matched: number;
  updated: number;
  unmatchedSample: { id: string; name: string }[];
  error?: string;
}>

Behavior:
- Fetch Goalserve: goalserveFetch(`soccerleague/${leagueId}`)
- Extract Goalserve teams from response.league.team (handle array OR single object)
- For each Goalserve team, read:
  - goalserveTeamId = String(team["@id"] ?? team.id)
  - name = String(team["@name"] ?? team.name ?? "")
- Load DB teams: select id, name, slug, shortName, goalserveTeamId from teams
- Build matching strategy in this order:
  1) If a DB team already has goalserveTeamId equal to the Goalserve id => match it
  2) Else match by slug using slugify(goalserveName) == db.slug
  3) Else match by case-insensitive name equality (db.name == goalserveName)
  4) Else match by case-insensitive shortName against known abbreviations derived from goalserveName:
     - Take first 3 letters of each word joined, e.g. "Manchester City" => "MCI"
     - Also take first 3 letters of the whole name with spaces removed
- When matched:
  - If db.goalserveTeamId is missing or different, update teams.goalserveTeamId to the Goalserve id
  - Count updated only when an UPDATE happens
- Collect unmatched goalserve teams (id+name) and return the first 15 as unmatchedSample
- Do NOT log or return any secrets

Also update server/routes.ts:

1) Add an import near the other job imports:
import { syncGoalserveTeams } from "./jobs/sync-goalserve-teams";

2) Add a new endpoint near the existing Goalserve job routes (keep organization consistent):

// ========== GOALSERVE TEAMS SYNC ==========
app.post(
  "/api/jobs/sync-goalserve-teams",
  requireJobSecret("GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET"),
  async (req, res) => {
    const leagueId = String(req.query.leagueId || "1204");
    const result = await syncGoalserveTeams(leagueId);
    res.json(result);
  }
);

Do NOT remove or reorder existing routes.

After edits:
- show full contents of server/jobs/sync-goalserve-teams.ts
- show a diff of server/routes.ts
- run npm run dev briefly to ensure server boots (stop after it starts)
