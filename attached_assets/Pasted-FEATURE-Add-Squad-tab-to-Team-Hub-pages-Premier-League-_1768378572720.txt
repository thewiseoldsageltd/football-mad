FEATURE: Add “Squad” tab to Team Hub pages (Premier League teams)

CONTEXT:
We have Team Hub pages with tabs: Latest, Injuries, Discipline, Transfers, Matches, Fans (see current UI). There is currently no Squad tab. We need a Squad tab that lists the club’s manager + player cards and links to profile pages.

GOALS:
1) Add a new Team Hub tab labelled “Squad” alongside existing tabs.
2) Create a Squad tab page that renders:
   - Manager / Head Coach card (top section)
   - Player cards grouped by position (GK, DEF, MID, FWD) or by “Position Group” if that’s what the dataset supports.
3) Each card drills down into:
   - Player profile page (canonical player entity URL)
   - Manager profile page (canonical manager entity URL)
4) Must be null-safe and must not break existing Team Hub tabs.
5) Use current design system + components (same spacing, typography, card styles, and mobile behavior as existing Team Hub tabs).
6) Do NOT introduce team crests/headshots changes in this PR. Keep avatar/initials behavior unchanged for now.

URL / ROUTING:
- Add a new canonical Team Hub route:
  /teams/[teamSlug]/squad
- Ensure the tab navigation points to this route and highlights correctly when active.

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
- Use existing entity-first approach: Team -> Players, Team -> Manager/Staff.
- If there is already a Team entity object available on Team Hub pages, extend it (or fetch additional fields) to include:
  - team.manager (or staff.manager)
  - team.players (array)
- If players are not yet available in your data layer, implement the tab with safe placeholders:
  - “Squad data coming soon” state, but keep the route, tab, and layout ready.
- Null-safe rendering:
  - If manager missing => hide manager section or show “Manager: TBC”
  - If players missing/empty => show empty state card with messaging and no errors.

UI SPEC:
Squad Tab Layout:
A) Header row:
   - “Squad” title
   - Optional: small count summary, e.g. “25 players” if players exist
B) Manager section:
   - Section label: “Manager”
   - Card with: name, role (Manager/Head Coach), nationality (if available), joined date (if available)
   - CTA link: “View profile” -> manager profile URL
C) Players section:
   - Section label: “Players”
   - Provide filter chips (mobile-friendly):
       All | Goalkeepers | Defenders | Midfielders | Forwards
     Default = All
   - In All view, group players by position group with subheadings.
   - Player cards in a responsive grid (2 columns mobile, 3-4 columns desktop, consistent with current site patterns).
   - Player card fields (only show what exists; hide missing fields):
       - Name
       - Position (short)
       - Shirt number (if available)
       - Availability indicator (optional, only if you already have injury/suspension status at player level; do not implement complex joins if not already present)
       - Small link: “View profile”
   - Use existing avatar treatment (initials or headshot if already supported). Do NOT alter global avatar logic.

ENTITY PAGES:
- If player/manager profile routes already exist, link to them.
- If they do not exist yet, create minimal stub pages that are canonical and future-proof:
   /players/[playerSlug]
   /managers/[managerSlug]
  Each stub should render:
   - Name + basic facts + “More data coming soon”
  Do not block Squad tab launch on fully built profiles.

IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT):
- Keep changes scoped.
- Prefer adding new components rather than rewriting Team Hub.
- Touch the fewest files possible:
  - Team Hub tab nav component to add “Squad”
  - New Squad tab page component
  - (Optional) New small components: ManagerCard, PlayerCard, PositionFilter
- Do not refactor unrelated tabs or URL logic.
- Maintain canonical URLs and no internal logic in URLs.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Squad tab appears on every Team Hub and routes to /teams/[teamSlug]/squad
- Page loads without errors even if manager/players data is missing (null-safe)
- When data exists, manager + players render with filters and position groupings
- Player and manager cards link to their entity pages (existing or stub)
- Design feels native to current Football Mad UI and works on mobile first

Proceed to implement now.
