You are working in the Football Mad repo (React + Tailwind). Do NOT run long test loops. Make only targeted changes and do a single quick manual sanity check by running the dev server and visually inspecting /matches.

Goal: Fix match card spacing/alignment on desktop + mobile so crests don’t drift with team-name length, spacing feels balanced on desktop, and truncation is consistent.

Requirements:
1) Update the match card layout (likely EnhancedMatchCard.tsx / MatchCard component) to use a consistent 3-column grid for the main row:
   - Left: Home team block (crest + name)
   - Middle: Competition pill (top) + kickoff time (below)
   - Right: Away team block (name + crest)
2) Inside each team block, use a 2-column layout with fixed crest width and a flexible name column:
   - Crest column fixed width (e.g., w-10 or w-11)
   - Name column uses min-w-0 and truncate
   - Home team: crest then name
   - Away team: name then crest (mirror)
3) Desktop: prevent teams being pushed to far edges.
   - The internal “main row” grid should be centered and capped with a max width (e.g., max-w-[820px] mx-auto w-full) while the card can remain full width.
4) Mobile: keep the same structure but ensure it stacks nicely within the card and doesn’t cause overflow.
   - Middle column (kickoff) should have a sensible min-width (e.g., min-w-[72px]) so names don’t squeeze it unpredictably.
   - Ensure no horizontal overflow; apply overflow-hidden where needed.
5) Keep the competition pill above the kickoff time in the middle column.
6) Do not reintroduce country text into the pill label. The pill should remain just the league name (flag already indicates country).
7) After change, do ONE quick check:
   - /matches on mobile viewport shows “Derby” and “West Brom” fully (or at least far less truncated than before) and crests aligned.
   - Desktop spacing feels balanced (teams not hugging center weirdly, not stretched to far edges).

Implementation notes:
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes. Use CSS grid and min-w-0 + truncate.
- Keep existing data/model logic unchanged; this is a layout-only change.

Deliverable:
- Provide the minimal code diff with the updated component(s).
- No lengthy automated test loops. One manual visual sanity check only.
