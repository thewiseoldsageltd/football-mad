You are working in the Football Mad Replit codebase. Make **targeted UI-only changes** (no refactors, no long test loops). Do **NOT** run lengthy E2E suites or “test/retest” loops — only do: `pnpm lint` (or equivalent) + a quick manual smoke check in the browser.

GOAL: Fix the Matches page layout regressions and mobile truncation issues.

--------------------------------------------
A) Revert the “hug the centre” layout on desktop
--------------------------------------------
Desktop looked better previously with natural spacing. Undo any recent changes that centered/hugged team names + crests toward the middle on desktop.

Acceptance:
- On desktop: home team/crest stays left, away team/crest stays right, kickoff time is centered between them (classic layout).
- No “compressed” center-hugging look.

--------------------------------------------
B) Make the competition pill SHORT again (remove country text everywhere)
--------------------------------------------
The pill should NOT include country in brackets or in any “• England” / “(England)” style.

Rules:
- The pill should display the competition/league name ONLY (e.g. “Championship”, “Serie A”, “Bundesliga 2”).
- The flag in the pill already conveys the country — no country name text appended in any format.
- This applies BOTH in match cards and in dropdown options.

Implementation hint:
- Find where `competitionLabel` (or any “disambiguated label”) is being built and remove the country suffix logic.
- Keep the country flag icon logic as-is.

Acceptance:
- No pills show “(England)” or “• England” or any country text.
- “Championship” remains “Championship” (flag still shows).

--------------------------------------------
C) Mobile: Stop team-name truncation + overflow (Derby/West Brom showing as “D…” / “W..”)
--------------------------------------------
Problem: a long pill is starving horizontal space, causing extreme truncation and even overflow off-screen.

Fix strategy (mobile-first):
1) On mobile, place the competition pill on its **own row at the top** of the card (full-width, centered).
2) The teams + kickoff row underneath should be a **3-column grid**:
   - Left column: home crest + home name (allow more width)
   - Middle: kickoff time (fixed width / does not wrap)
   - Right column: away name + away crest (allow more width)
3) Ensure text truncation is sensible (e.g. `truncate`), but names should generally show much more than 1 character.
4) Ensure NOTHING bleeds outside the card:
   - Add `min-w-0` to grid children where needed
   - Use `overflow-hidden` on the card content container if required

Desktop should remain the classic single-row layout (pill should NOT push kickoff time down on desktop):
- On desktop, pill should sit above the teams/time row OR be positioned so the kickoff time stays aligned with team names/crests (no vertical push that breaks alignment).

Acceptance:
- On mobile: “Derby” and “West Brom” show materially more characters (not just “D…” / “W..”).
- No horizontal overflow off the right edge.
- Kickoff time stays centered and readable.

--------------------------------------------
D) Desktop: “one fixture per line” (no 2-column grid) + faint divider between competition groups
--------------------------------------------
Change desktop layout so matches render as a single column list (one match card per row).
Add a subtle divider line between competition groups (when the competition changes) — faint, consistent with existing UI.

Acceptance:
- Desktop: never shows 2 matches side-by-side on Matches list.
- A faint divider appears between competition sections.

--------------------------------------------
E) Filters UX (mobile)
--------------------------------------------
You already have “Filter by…” and “Sort by…” placeholders — keep that.
On mobile:
- Center the placeholder text
- Keep the dropdown chevron aligned right (consistent with the rest of the site)

Acceptance:
- On mobile: “Filter by…” is visually centered; chevron is right-aligned within the select.

--------------------------------------------
FILES (likely)
- `client/src/components/MatchesList.tsx` (grouping + divider insertion)
- `client/src/components/EnhancedMatchCard.tsx` (layout/pill rendering)
- `client/src/pages/matches.tsx` (filter selects styling/props)

--------------------------------------------
CONSTRAINTS
- Do not rework backend or sorting logic — UI only.
- Do not introduce new libraries.
- Minimal code changes; no massive refactors.
- Avoid long-running tests. Only quick lint + manual check.

DELIVERABLE
1) Implement the changes.
2) Provide a concise summary of what changed and where (file + key edits).
3) Confirm acceptance criteria items A–E.
