BUILD: Goalserve-driven “Squad” tab + Player Profile UI using MOCK DATA (no API calls yet)

CONTEXT:
We have Football Mad Team Hub pages with tabs. “Squad” tab route exists now (structure in place) but needs final UI driven by Goalserve Soccer Data Feed fields. We want a realistic preview before API key arrives.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- NO live API calls.
- Use mock data objects shaped like Goalserve responses.
- Keep changes scoped: do not refactor other Team Hub tabs.
- Null-safe rendering everywhere.
- Use existing design system/components and match current Football Mad UI style (mobile-first).

ROUTES:
1) Team Squad tab:
   /teams/[teamSlug]/squad

2) Player profile page:
   /players/[playerSlug]
(If playerSlug mapping doesn’t exist, create a minimal helper that slugifies player name for now.)

DATA SHAPE (MOCK):
Create mock data that mimics Goalserve squad + player profile:

A) Squad list items should include these fields (strings OK):
- id
- name
- position: "G" | "D" | "M" | "A"
- number
- isCaptain (0/1)
- minutes
- appearances
- goals
- assists
- yellowcards
- redcards
- rating
- shots_total
- shots_ontarget
- key_passes
- tackles
- saves
- goals_conceded
(These are based on squad stats fields in Goalserve league/team feeds.)

B) Availability mapping mock (based on Goalserve injuries feed concept):
Create two arrays:
- to_miss: [{ playerId, status }]
- questionable: [{ playerId, status }]
Use these to show availability pills on player cards:
- to_miss => “Out (next match)”
- questionable => “Doubtful (next match)”
Include the injury status text (e.g. “Hamstring injury”).
If not present in either list => no pill (or “Available” only if you already have such a pattern).

C) Player Profile mock object:
- id
- name
- positionText: "Goalkeeper" | "Defender" | "Midfielder" | "Attacker"
- imageBase64 (can be empty string to test fallback; do not fetch external images)
- nationality (optional)
- age (optional)
- height (optional)
- preferredFoot (optional)
- currentClubName (optional)
- seasonSummary: minutes, appearances, goals, assists, yellowcards, redcards, rating
- careerStatsTabs:
   - domesticLeague: array of seasons
   - domesticCups: array of seasons
   - intlClubCups: array of seasons
   - international: array of seasons
Each season row: season, club, apps, goals, assists, minutes (all optional).
- transfers: array of { date, from, to, fee }
- sidelined: array of { type, start, end, description } (injury/suspension history)
- trophies: array of { competition, season }

UI REQUIREMENTS: SQUAD TAB PAGE
1) Page header:
- Title: “Squad”
- Player count (e.g. “25 players”) if squad exists.

2) Controls row (mobile-friendly):
- Search input (filters by player name)
- Position filter chips: All | GK | DEF | MID | FWD
- Sort dropdown: Rating | Minutes | Goals | Assists | Shirt No.
Sorting should work on the currently filtered list.

3) Grouped view:
When filter = All, group players into sections:
- Goalkeepers (position "G")
- Defenders ("D")
- Midfielders ("M")
- Attackers ("A")
Each section has a heading and a responsive card grid.

4) Player card:
- Avatar circle (initials) – do not change global avatar system, but for this mock UI use a simple initials circle.
- Name (clickable -> /players/[playerSlug])
- Position label + shirt number
- Captain badge if isCaptain=1
- Availability pill if player in to_miss/questionable (use distinct styles but do NOT implement injury ring logic here).
- Key stats row (compact):
  Everyone: Minutes, Apps, Goals, Assists, Rating
  If GK: show Saves + Conceded instead of Shots/Key passes/tackles
  If outfield: optionally show Key Passes OR Shots on target (choose one to avoid clutter)
Hide stats that are missing/empty.

5) Empty states:
- If no squad: show “Squad data coming soon.”
- If filters return no players: show “No players match your filters.”

UI REQUIREMENTS: PLAYER PROFILE PAGE
1) Header:
- Avatar image if imageBase64 exists (render as data URL); else initials fallback.
- Name, positionText, nationality (if present), and a small current club link back to team hub (if available).
2) “This season” quick block:
- Minutes, Apps, Goals, Assists, Cards, Rating (only what exists)
3) Tabs:
- Domestic League | Domestic Cups | Intl Club Cups | International
Each tab shows a table of season rows (Season, Club, Apps, Goals, Assists, Minutes)
4) Transfers section:
- Timeline/list
5) Injury/Suspension history section:
- Timeline rendering of sidelined entries
6) Trophies section:
- Simple list grouped by competition if possible

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS:
- Implement this as a UI-only preview using mock data in a dedicated file/module (e.g. /lib/mock/goalserveMock.ts).
- Add a feature flag constant (e.g. USE_GOALSERVE_MOCK = true) so later we can swap the data source cleanly.
- Create small reusable components:
  - SquadControls
  - PlayerCard
  - PositionGroup
  - PlayerProfileHeader
  - StatsTabs
  - TimelineList
- Keep styling consistent with the existing Football Mad UI (cards, spacing, typography).
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (stack controls, 2-column grid on mobile).

DELIVERABLE:
After implementation, the Squad tab should look “real” with mock data and clicking a player should navigate to a complete-looking Player Profile page populated from mock data.

Proceed to implement now.
