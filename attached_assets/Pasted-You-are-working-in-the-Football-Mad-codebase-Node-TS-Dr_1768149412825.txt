You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Node/TS + Drizzle). We already have an FPL sync job and need a similar ingestion job for TEAM METADATA (manager + stadium) because some teams are missing these fields and some managers are incorrect.

GOAL
1) Create a new server sync job that fetches manager + stadium data from Wikidata (free/public) using the Wikidata Query Service SPARQL endpoint.
2) Update the existing `teams` table rows (by slug) with:
   - `stadiumName`
   - `manager`
   - ensure consistent `name` (display name) exactly as per the list below (do NOT use “Bournemouth FC”, “Brighton”, etc. unless it matches the list).
3) Add a secret key auth for this sync endpoint, similar to the FPL sync secret (env var).
4) Add a POST endpoint to trigger the job: POST /api/jobs/sync-team-metadata
   - Requires header `x-sync-secret: <secret>` or JSON body { secret: "<secret>" } (pick one and be consistent)
   - Returns { updated: number, skipped: number, errors: string[] }

DISPLAY NAME + SLUG SOURCE OF TRUTH (keep slugs as-is, set `teams.name` to these exact display names)
- Arsenal (arsenal)
- Aston Villa (aston-villa)
- Bournemouth (afc-bournemouth)
- Brentford (brentford)
- Brighton (brighton-and-hove-albion)
- Burnley (burnley)
- Chelsea (chelsea)
- Crystal Palace (crystal-palace)
- Everton (everton)
- Fulham (fulham)
- Leeds (leeds-united)
- Liverpool (liverpool)
- Man City (manchester-city)
- Man Utd (manchester-united)
- Newcastle (newcastle-united)
- Nottingham Forest (nottingham-forest)
- Sunderland (sunderland)
- Tottenham (tottenham-hotspur)
- West Ham (west-ham-united)
- Wolves (wolverhampton-wanderers)

IMPORTANT
- Some stadium/manager values may be missing or returned under slightly different naming. Use sensible fallbacks:
  - If manager is missing from Wikidata for a club, do not overwrite an existing non-empty `teams.manager`.
  - If stadium is missing from Wikidata for a club, do not overwrite an existing non-empty `teams.stadiumName`.
- Create a small “manual override” object in code keyed by slug for any known exceptions we may need later. For now, keep it empty but wired in.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Create `server/team-metadata-sync.ts` (or similar) that:
   1) Runs a SPARQL query against:
      https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?format=json&query=...
   2) The query should fetch clubs currently associated with the Premier League competition and return:
      - club label (English)
      - stadium label (English)
      - coach/manager label (English)
   3) Normalize and map results to our slugs using the display-name mapping above.
      - Normalize comparison by lowercasing, stripping punctuation, trimming spaces.
      - Ensure “Manchester City” maps to “Man City”, “Manchester United” -> “Man Utd”, “Wolverhampton Wanderers” -> “Wolves”, etc. Use our mapping list as the canonical key.

B) Add a POST route handler in `server/routes.ts` (or your existing jobs router) similar to the FPL job:
   - POST /api/jobs/sync-team-metadata
   - Verify secret matches env var TEAM_SYNC_SECRET (create this env var).
   - Call the sync function and return the results as JSON.

C) Update DB rows:
   - For each slug in the list above, ensure `teams.name` is set exactly to the display name from the list.
   - Update `teams.manager` and `teams.stadiumName` if Wikidata provided values (and only overwrite empties unless we explicitly decide otherwise).
   - Keep any other fields untouched.

D) Add minimal logging and robust error handling:
   - Collect per-team errors but continue processing.
   - Return counts.

E) Provide a short note in docs/ or BUILD_LOG.md describing:
   - How to set TEAM_SYNC_SECRET
   - How to trigger: curl example

After implementing, run a quick sanity check by printing the updated rows (or add a small console log summary) so we can see which teams were updated and which were skipped.
