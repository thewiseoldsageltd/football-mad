You are working in the Football Mad codebase (Next.js + Tailwind). We’re starting Day 6: prepare the Matches tab UI so it’s Goalserve-ready later, but for now use mock data.

GOAL
Build a new Matches page that matches the existing site styling and navigation conventions (same header layout, spacing, typography, container widths). This is UI scaffolding only — no Goalserve integration yet.

ROUTES / FILES
- Create/Update: `app/matches/page.tsx`
- Create reusable components in: `components/matches/*`
- If there is already a Matches page, refactor it to match the spec below.
- Do not break existing navigation.

DESKTOP LAYOUT (must match site look)
1) Page header
- Title: “Matches”
- Subtitle: “Premier League fixtures and results”
- Use the existing icon/heading style seen on other tabs (e.g. News/Injuries).

2) Sub-navigation row (same grey bar + lozenge active state pattern used across the site)
Tabs:
- Today (count optional for now)
- Tomorrow
- This Week
- Results

Rules:
- Use the same “lozenge highlight” for active tab.
- Keep the grey bar style consistent with Injuries tab.
- If you show counts, use ONE consistent format across all tabs. For Matches, use bracket style e.g. `Today (3)` for now.
- On desktop, show Filters on the SAME horizontal line as the sub-nav and aligned right.

3) Filters (desktop inline, right aligned)
- Competition dropdown (default: Premier League)
- Sort dropdown (default: Kick-off time)
- A “Team” search input (optional, can be simple and inactive)
These filters do not need to function fully yet, but the UI should exist.

CONTENT (desktop)
- Group matches by date.
- Within each date group, group by competition (for now just Premier League in mock data).
- Use a clean match card component that supports 3 states:
  A) Scheduled: shows time + teams + venue (if available)
  B) Live: shows score + live minute + subtle live indicator
  C) Finished: shows final score + FT badge

Match card structure:
- Competition pill at top-left (small)
- Center row with:
  Home team (left), score/time (middle), away team (right)
- Secondary row:
  Date/time/venue line (small, muted)
- Optional status badge on the right (e.g. LIVE, FT, P-P for postponed)

VISUAL STYLE
- Reuse existing card styles: rounded corners, soft shadow, light border.
- Typography should match the rest of Football Mad (don’t introduce new font systems).
- Maintain spacing consistency with other pages.
- Keep it clean/minimal; no heavy colours except the site green for accents and a subtle red for LIVE.

MOBILE RULES
- Sub-navigation must be horizontally scrollable (like Injuries).
- Keep the “fade” scroll hint ONLY on the RIGHT side (no left fade).
- Filters must be full width and stacked:
  - Competition dropdown
  - Team search
  - Sort dropdown
- Match list is single-column, grouped by date.
- Date headers can be sticky (nice to have, not required).

MOCK DATA
Create a small mock dataset in `components/matches/mockMatches.ts` (or similar) with:
- 1–2 date groups for Today
- 1 date group for Tomorrow
- 1 week group for This Week
Include at least:
- 2 scheduled matches
- 1 live match
- 2 finished matches
Each match object should include:
`id, competition, dateISO, kickOffTime, status (scheduled|live|finished|postponed), minute (optional), homeTeam, awayTeam, homeScore, awayScore, venue (optional)`

BEHAVIOUR
- Tabs change the displayed list (client-side state is fine).
- Results tab can just show finished matches.
- Sorting can be stubbed (UI only), but implement simple sort by time if easy.
- Clicking a match card can be non-functional for now (cursor pointer optional).

DELIVERABLE
- A polished Matches page that looks like a finished product even with mock data.
- Clean component structure:
  - `MatchesTabs`
  - `MatchesFilters`
  - `MatchCard`
  - `MatchesList` (grouping by date)
- No console errors. No broken imports.

After implementation:
- Briefly list which files you changed/created.
- Confirm mobile + desktop behaviour matches the rules above.
