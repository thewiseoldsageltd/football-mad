We just found the key detail: the EPL fixtures XML includes `<week number="1"> ... <week number="38">`, but the JSON form we’re currently using doesn’t surface any round/matchweek labels. That’s why the Matchweek toggle shows “1” while displaying MW23 data, and why it won’t navigate.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT run regression tests, videos, test suites, or extra scripts.
- Make surgical changes only: fix matchweek toggles + correct matchweek labeling and default selection.
- No refactors, no unrelated formatting.

TASK
1) Backend: ensure the leagues fixtures API returns a proper list of matchweeks derived from Goalserve XML `<week number="X">` containers.
2) Frontend: make the matchweek toggle work by using the backend-provided matchweeks list (not guessed), and:
   - Always label as “Matchweek X”
   - Start at Matchweek 1 on the far-left
   - Default to the latest Matchweek that has fixtures or results (i.e., any matches at all), prefer the latest that is not entirely in the future if you can infer it.
3) Keep existing UI layout; only fix the logic.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

A) BACKEND (server/routes.ts or wherever the leagues/fixtures endpoint is)
- Locate the endpoint used by the Leagues tab sidebar (the one feeding matchweek fixtures).
- Change the Goalserve fetch for league fixtures to pull XML (NO `?json=1`) so we can read `<week number="...">`.
  Example:
    https://www.goalserve.com/getfeed/${GS_KEY}/soccerfixtures/leagueid/${leagueId}
- Parse XML using the same parser already used elsewhere (fast-xml-parser or equivalent) with attributes enabled.
- Extract weeks from the payload:
  - Find the container that holds `<week number="X">` nodes (it appears directly under the league fixtures feed).
  - For each week node:
      weekNumber = attribute "number"
      matches = any `<match ...>` children (support single object or array)
  - Reuse the existing match parsing logic (teams, score, status, kickoffDate, kickoffTime, penalties, etc.)
- Return a response shape that includes:
  {
    leagueId: "...",
    matchweeks: [
      { number: 1, label: "Matchweek 1", matches: [...] },
      ...
      { number: 38, label: "Matchweek 38", matches: [...] }
    ],
    defaultMatchweek: <number>
  }
- defaultMatchweek logic:
  - Choose the greatest weekNumber where matches.length > 0.
  - If you can detect “future-only” weeks: prefer the greatest week where at least one match status is not "Not Started"/"NS" OR (kickoffDate <= today in Europe/London). If that’s too risky, just use greatest week with matches.
- IMPORTANT: Do not break Europe/UCL logic. This change is for league matchweeks only (Leagues tab), not cups and not /api/europe.

B) FRONTEND
- Find the league matchweek sidebar/toggle component you recently added (prev/next buttons and “Matchweek X” label).
- Update it to use `matchweeks` returned from the backend:
  - Build an ordered array of week numbers from the response.
  - The displayed label is the selected week’s label from the API (or `Matchweek ${n}`).
  - Prev/next should navigate the index inside that array.
  - Disable prev when at index 0, disable next at last index.
- Default selection:
  - If URL has ?matchweek=, use it (parse int).
  - Else use `defaultMatchweek` from API.
- Ensure the fixtures list updates when selected matchweek changes.
- Ensure the label matches the selected data (no more MW1 showing MW23).

C) QUICK FIX FOR YOUR GREP WARNING (optional, no effect on app)
- Ignore; it was a shell quoting issue and not part of app.

DELIVERABLE
- Make the code changes only. Do NOT run tests/videos. Do NOT add debug logs.

After changes, the user will manually verify:
- Matchweek label matches the fixtures shown
- Prev/next toggles actually change matchweek and fixtures
- Default lands on latest matchweek with data
