You are working in the Football Mad codebase.

Goal:
Enable League One and League Two standings in the Tables page using the same “near-live” autoRefresh + polling pipeline we already implemented for Premier League and Championship, with correct EFL-specific zones and legend.

Context:
- Standings are fetched via GET /api/standings?leagueId=XXXX&season=YYYY/YYYY&autoRefresh=1
- The client polls every 60s on /tables.
- server/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings.ts already supports auto-creating missing teams, and we also have:
  - POST /api/jobs/purge-standings?leagueId=XXXX&season=YYYY/YYYY (x-sync-secret required)
  - POST /api/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings?leagueId=XXXX&force=1 (x-sync-secret required)

Tasks:

A) League config: add standingsZones for League One + League Two
1) Open: client/src/lib/league-config.ts
2) Find existing league entries for “league-one” and “league-two”.
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT guess goalserveLeagueId values.
   - Use the existing goalserveLeagueId from the file. If a league entry doesn’t exist, create it but only after checking if it exists elsewhere in the project (search for “league-one” and “league-two”).
3) Add standingsZones to each league config with these rules:

League One zones:
- Automatic Promotion: positions 1–2 (use emerald)
- Playoffs: positions 3–6 (use amber)
- Relegation: positions 21–24 (use red)
Legend labels must match these exactly.

League Two zones:
- Automatic Promotion: positions 1–3 (use emerald)
- Playoffs: positions 4–7 (use amber)
- Relegation: positions 23–24 (use red)
Legend labels must match these exactly.

Notes:
- We already have types StandingsZone and ZoneColor and a zones-driven legend in LeagueTable. Reuse the same structure used for ChampionshipZones/PLZones.
- Ensure LeagueTable receives zones from the currently selected league config (this should already exist). If it doesn’t, wire it the same way as Championship.

B) Tabs: ensure League One + League Two appear in the Tables UI
1) Open: client/src/data/tables-mock.ts
2) Ensure “League One” and “League Two” tabs exist with ids matching the league-config slugs (e.g. “league-one”, “league-two”).
   - If they already exist, do nothing.
   - If not, add them in the same style as Championship and Premier League.

C) Ingestion verification helpers (no new UI required)
1) Add a short note to docs/BUILD_LOG.md with the exact curl commands a dev can run to:
   - Purge standings for League One/Two for season 2025/2026
   - Force reingest standings for League One/Two
   Use placeholders like LEAGUE_ONE_ID and LEAGUE_TWO_ID, but also include a note telling the dev to copy the goalserveLeagueId values from client/src/lib/league-config.ts.

Example command format (keep consistent):
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "x-sync-secret: $GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET" \
  "https://<replit-domain>/api/jobs/purge-standings?leagueId=LEAGUE_ONE_ID&season=2025/2026"

curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "x-sync-secret: $GOALSERVE_SYNC_SECRET" \
  "https://<replit-domain>/api/jobs/upsert-goalserve-standings?leagueId=LEAGUE_ONE_ID&force=1"

Same for League Two.

D) Acceptance checks
After implementing:
1) Navigate to /tables and click League One, then League Two.
2) Confirm the legend shows:
   - League One: Automatic Promotion, Playoffs, Relegation (no Champions League / Europa)
   - League Two: Automatic Promotion, Playoffs, Relegation
3) Confirm the left stripe highlights match the rules above.
4) Confirm the network requests include autoRefresh=1 and repeat ~every 60s on /tables.

Make only the necessary changes. Keep code consistent with existing patterns.
