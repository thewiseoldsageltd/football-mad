We are continuing work on the Football Mad cup progress system.

IMPORTANT WORKING RULES:
• The user is NOT editing files directly.
• Return ALL code updates as ONE Replit AI prompt in a single copy-paste code block.
• DO NOT perform full regression testing.
• DO NOT refactor existing FA Cup / EFL Cup / Copa del Rey logic.
• DO NOT touch unrelated competitions.
• DO NOT modify UI components or styling.
• Keep changes minimal and localized.

TASK:
Add Coppa Italia (Goalserve competitionId = 1264) to the existing system.

1) client/src/lib/cup-config.ts
- Add a new cup config entry for Coppa Italia:
  slug: "coppa-italia"
  name: "Coppa Italia"
  shortName: "CI"
  goalserveCompetitionId: "1264"
  country: "Italy"
- Do NOT change existing entries.

2) server/routes.ts (the /api/cup/progress handler)
- Add a new flag:
  const isCoppaItalia = competitionId === "1264";
- Add COPPA_ITALIA_CANONICAL_ROUNDS that mirrors Goalserve-native stage names and ordering:
  1/64-finals (order 1)
  1/32-finals (order 2)
  1/16-finals (order 3)
  1/8-finals  (order 4)
  Quarter-finals (order 5)
  Semi-finals (order 6)
  Final (order 7)

- Add a Coppa Italia round normalizer used only when isCoppaItalia === true:
  Rules:
   • if name contains "1/64" -> "1/64-finals"
   • if name contains "1/32" -> "1/32-finals"
   • if name contains "1/16" -> "1/16-finals"
   • if name contains "1/8"  -> "1/8-finals"
   • if name contains "quarter" or equals "qf" -> "Quarter-finals"
   • if name contains "semi" -> "Semi-finals"
   • if name contains "final" (but NOT semi) -> "Final"
  Keep case-insensitive matching and preserve existing behavior for unknown rounds (do not remove unknown rounds).

- Ensure the canonical seeding logic for Coppa Italia includes all canonical rounds even if there are 0 fixtures (Semi-finals and Final will likely be empty right now because Goalserve hasn’t provided them yet).

- Do NOT alter the canonical systems for FA Cup, EFL Cup, or Copa del Rey.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Return ONE backend+config code update prompt only. No explanations outside this block.
